The Raven

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping—rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—
Only this and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
This it is and nothing more."

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping—tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you"—here I opened wide the door:—
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;—
'Tis the wind and nothing more."

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as "Nevermore."

But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
Then the bird said, "Nevermore."

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore
Of 'Never—nevermore.'"

But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite—respite and nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us — by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore —
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting—
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!

The Bells

I	Hear the sledges with the bells—
Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In their icy air of night!
While the stars, that oversprinkle
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells—
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
II	Hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten golden-notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
How it swells!
How it dwells
On the future! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells, bells, bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells—
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!
III	Hear the loud alarum bells—
Brazen bells!
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
Now—now to sit or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging,
And the clanging,
How the danger ebbs and flows;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
In the jangling,
And the wrangling,
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells—
Of the bells—
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells—
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!
IV	Hear the tolling of the bells —
Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the people—ah, the people—
They that dwell up in the steeple.
All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone—
They are neither man nor woman—
They are neither brute nor human —
They are Ghouls:
And their king it is who tolls;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
Rolls
A pæan from the bells!
And his merry bosom swells
With the pæan of the bells!
And he dances, and he yells;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the pæan of the bells —
Of the bells:
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the throbbing of the bells —
Of the bells, bells, bells —
To the sobbing of the bells;
Keeping time, time, time,
As he knells, knells, knells,
In a happy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells—
Of the bells, bells, bells-
To the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells —
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

Ulalume

The skies they were ashen and sober;
The leaves they were crisped and sere—
The leaves they were withering and sere;
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year;
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
In the misty mid region of Weir—
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

Here once, through an alley Titanic.
Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—
Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll—
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole—
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole.

Our talk had been serious and sober,
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—
Our memories were treacherous and sere—
For we knew not the month was October,
And we marked not the night of the year—
(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
We noted not the dim lake of Auber—
(Though once we had journeyed down here)—
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

And now as the night was senescent
And star-dials pointed to morn—
As the sun-dials hinted of morn—
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born,
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn—
Astarte's bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn.

And I said—"She is warmer than Dian:
She rolls through an ether of sighs—
She revels in a region of sighs:
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies—
To the Lethean peace of the skies—
Come up, in despite of the Lion,
To shine on us with her bright eyes—
Come up through the lair of the Lion,
With love in her luminous eyes."

But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
Said—"Sadly this star I mistrust—
Her pallor I strangely mistrust:—
Oh, hasten!—oh, let us not linger!
Oh, fly!—let us fly!—for we must."
In terror she spoke, letting sink her
Wings till they trailed in the dust—
In agony sobbed, letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust—
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

I replied—"This is nothing but dreaming:
Let us on by this tremulous light!
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty to-night:—
See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
And be sure it will lead us aright—
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright,
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."

Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
And tempted her out of her gloom—
And conquered her scruples and gloom;
And we passed to the end of a vista,
But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
By the door of a legended tomb;
And I said—"What is written, sweet sister,
On the door of this legended tomb?"
She replied—"Ulalume—Ulalume—
'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere—
As the leaves that were withering and sere;
And I cried—"It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed—I journeyed down here—
That I brought a dread burden down here!
On this night of all nights in the year,
Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—
This misty mid region of Weir—
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,—
This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."

To Helen

I saw thee once—once only—years ago:
I must not say how many—but not many.
It was a July midnight; and from out
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe—
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That gave out, in return for the love-light,
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death—
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.

Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,
And on thine own, upturn'd—alas, in sorrow!

Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight—
Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),
That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,
Save only thee and me—(O Heaven!—O God!
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)—
Save only thee and me. I paused—I looked—
And in an instant all things disappeared.
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)
The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
The happy flowers and the repining trees,
Were seen no more: the very roses' odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
All—all expired save thee—save less than thou:
Save only the divine light in thine eyes—
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
I saw but them—they were the world to me.
I saw but them—saw only them for hours—
Saw only them until the moon went down.
What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!
How silently serene a sea of pride!
How daring an ambition! yet how deep—
How fathomless a capacity for love!

But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,
Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained.
They would not go—they never yet have gone.
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since.
They follow me—they lead me through the years.

They are my ministers—yet I their slave.
Their office is to illumine and enkindle—
My duty, to be saved by their bright light,
And purified in their electric fire,
And sanctified in their elysian fire.
They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),
And are far up in Heaven—the stars I kneel to
In the sad, silent watches of my night;
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still—two sweetly scintillant
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!

Annabel Lee

It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we—
Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
In her sepulchre there by the sea—
In her tomb by the side of the sea.

A Valentine

For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,
Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies
Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
Search narrowly the lines!—they hold a treasure
Divine—a talisman—an amulet
That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure—
The words—the syllables! Do not forget
The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!
And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
Which one might not undo without a sabre,
If one could merely comprehend the plot.
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
Of poets by poets—as the name is a poet's, too.
Its letters, although naturally lying
Like the knight Pinto—Mendez Ferdinando—
Still form a synonym for Truth—Cease trying!
You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.

An Enigma

"Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce,
"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a Naples bonnet—
Trash of all trash!—how can a lady don it?
Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff—
Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it."
And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles—ephemeral and so transparent—
But this is, now—you may depend upon it—
Stable, opaque, immortal—all by dint
Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.

To My Mother

Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
The angels, whispering to one another,
Can find, among their burning terms of love,
None so devotional as that of "Mother,"
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—
You who are more than mother unto me,
And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,
In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
My mother—my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.

For Annie

Thank Heaven! the crisis—
The danger is past,
And the lingering illness
Is over at last—
And the fever called "Living"
Is conquered at last.

Sadly, I know,
I am shorn of my strength,
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length—
But no matter!—I feel
I am better at length.

And I rest so composedly,
Now in my bed,
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead—
Might start at beholding me
Thinking me dead.

The moaning and groaning,
The sighing and sobbing,
Are quieted now,
With that horrible throbbing
At heart:—ah, that horrible,
Horrible throbbing!

The sickness—the nausea—
The pitiless pain—
Have ceased, with the fever
That maddened my brain—
With the fever called "Living"
That burned in my brain.

And oh! of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated—the terrible
Torture of thirst,
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst:—
I have drank of a water
That quenches all thirst:—

Of a water that flows,
With a lullaby sound,
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground—
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground.

And ah! let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed—
For man never slept
In a different bed;
And, to sleep, you must slumber
In just such a bed.

My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes,
Forgetting, or never
Regretting its roses—
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses:

For now, while so quietly
Lying, it fancies
A holier odor
About it, of pansies—
A rosemary odor,
Commingled with pansies—
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies.

And so it lies happily,
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie—
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie.

She tenderly kissed me,
She fondly caressed,
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast—
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast.

When the light was extinguished,
She covered me warm,
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm—
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm.

And I lie so composedly,
Now in my bed
(Knowing her love)
That you fancy me dead—
And I rest so contentedly,
Now in my bed,
(With her love at my breast)
That you fancy me dead—
That you shudder to look at me.
Thinking me dead.

But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky,
For it sparkles with Annie—
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie—
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie.

To F——

Beloved! amid the earnest woes
That crowd around my earthly path—
(Drear path, alas! where grows
Not even one lonely rose)—
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee, and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose.

And thus thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted far-off isle
In some tumultuous sea—
Some ocean throbbing far and free
With storm—but where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just o'er that one bright inland smile.

To Frances S. Osgood

Thou wouldst be loved?—then let thy heart
From its present pathway part not;
Being everything which now thou art,
Be nothing which thou art not.
So with the world thy gentle ways,

Shall be an endless theme of praise.
And love a simple duty.

Eldorado

Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,
In search of Eldorado.
But he grew old—
This knight so bold—
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado.

And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow—
"Shadow," said he,
"Where can it be—
This land of Eldorado?"

"Over the Mountains
Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the Shadow,
Ride, boldly ride,"
The shade replied,
"If you seek for Eldorado!"

Eulalie

I dwelt alone
In a world of moan,
And my soul was a stagnant tide,
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride—
Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.
Ah, less—less bright
The stars of the night
Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
And never a flake
That the vapor can make
With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl—
Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless curl.
Now Doubt—now Pain
Come never again,
For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
And all day long
Shines, bright and strong,
Astarté within the sky,
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye—
While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.

A Dream within a Dream

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow—
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream:
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand—
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep—while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

Marie Louise (Shew)

Of all who hail thy presence as the morning—
Of all to whom thine absence is the night—
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun—of all who, weeping, bless thee
Hourly for hope—for life—ah, above all,
For the resurrection of deep buried faith
In truth, in virtue, in humanity—
Of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed
Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!"
At thy soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
In thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes—
Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship,—oh, remember
The truest, the most fervently devoted,
And think that these weak lines are written by him—
By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angel's.

(2) To Marie Louise (Shew)

Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
In the mad pride of intellectuality,
Maintained "the power of words"—denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
Two words—two foreign soft dissyllables—
Italian tones, made only to be murmured
By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"—
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,
(Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,")
Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
I cannot write—I cannot speak or think—
Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
This standing motionless upon the golden
Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
Upon the left, and all the way along,
Amid empurpled vapors, far away
To where the prospect terminates—thee only!

The City in the Sea

Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.

No rays from the holy Heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently—
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—
Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—
Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers—
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet, and the vine.

Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.

There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye—
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along that wilderness of glass—
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea—
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.

But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave—there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide—
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow—
The hours are breathing faint and low—
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.

The Sleeper

At midnight, in the month of June,
I stand beneath the mystic moon.
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
Exhales from out her golden rim,
And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
Upon the quiet mountain top,
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley.
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast,
The ruin moulders into rest;
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take,
And would not, for the world, awake.
All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies
(Her casement open to the skies)
Irene, with her Destinies!

Oh, lady bright! can it be right—
This window open to the night!
The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
Laughingly through the lattice-drop—
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
Flit through thy chamber in and out,
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully—so fearfully—
Above the closed and fringed lid
'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,
That, o'er the floor and down the wall,
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
And this all-solemn silentness!

The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep
Which is enduring, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
This bed for one more melancholy,
I pray to God that she may lie
For ever with unopened eye,
While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!

My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep;
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
For her may some tall vault unfold—
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And winged panels fluttering back,
Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,
Of her grand family funerals—
Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
Against whose portal she hath thrown,
In childhood many an idle stone—
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She ne'er shall force an echo more,
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
It was the dead who groaned within.

Bridal Ballad

The ring is on my hand,
And the wreath is on my brow;
Satins and jewels grand
Are all at my command.
And I am happy now.

And my lord he loves me well;
But, when first he breathed his vow,
I felt my bosom swell—
For the words rang as a knell,
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell,
And who is happy now.

But he spoke to reassure me,
And he kissed my pallid brow,
While a reverie came o'er me,
And to the churchyard bore me,
And I sighed to him before me,
Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
"Oh, I am happy now!"

And thus the words were spoken,
And thus the plighted vow,
And, though my faith be broken,
And, though my heart be broken,
Behold the golden keys
That proves me happy now!

Would to God I could awaken
For I dream I know not how,
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken,—
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now.

Note on The Raven

"The Raven" was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New York Evening Mirror—a paper its author was then assistant editor of. It was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N. P. Willis:
"We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second number of the American Review, the following remarkable poem by Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of 'fugitive poetry' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and 'pokerishness.' It is one of those 'dainties bred in a book' which we feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it."
In the February number of the American Review the poem was published as by "Quarles," and it was introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by Poe himself.
["The following lines from a correspondent—besides the deep, quaint strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the author—appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of 'The Raven' arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form: but the presence in all the others of one line—mostly the second in the verse" (stanza?)—"which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphio Adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect. We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were better understood."

Ed. Am. Rev.]

Note on The Bells

The bibliographical history of "The Bells" is curious. The subject, and some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet's friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem, headed it, "The Bells. By Mrs. M. A. Shew." This draft, now the editor's property, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus:

I	The bells!—ah the bells!
The little silver bells!
How fairy-like a melody there floats
From their throats—
From their merry little throats—
From the silver, tinkling throats
Of the bells, bells, bells—
Of the bells!
II	The bells!—ah, the bells!
The heavy iron bells!
How horrible a monody there floats
From their throats—
From their deep-toned throats—
From their melancholy throats
How I shudder at the notes
Of the bells, bells, bells—
Of the bells!


In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to the editor of the Union Magazine. It was not published. So, in the following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version, was sent, and in the following October was published in the Union Magazine.
Contents


Note on Ulalume

This poem was first published in Colton's American Review for December 1847, as "To — — Ulalume: a Ballad." Being reprinted immediately in the Home Journal, it was copied into various publications with the name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him. When first published, it contained the following additional stanza which Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman wisely suppressed:
Said we then—the two, then—"Ah, can it
Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—
The pitiful, the merciful ghouls—
To bar up our path and to ban it
From the secret that lies in these wolds—
Had drawn up the spectre of a planet
From the limbo of lunary souls—
This sinfully scintillant planet
From the Hell of the planetary souls?"

Contents


Note on To Helen

"To Helen" (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published Until November 1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the Union Magazine and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or desire of Poe, of the line, "Oh, God! oh, Heaven—how my heart beats in coupling those two words".
Contents


Note on Annabel Lee

"Annabel Lee" was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression of the poet's undying love for his deceased bride although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a copy of the ballad to the Union Magazine, in which publication it appeared in January 1850, three months after the author's death. Whilst suffering from "hope deferred" as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of "Annabel Lee" to the editor of the Southern Literary Messenger, who published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe's death. In the meantime the poet's own copy, left among his papers, passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York Tribune, before any one else had an opportunity of publishing it.
Contents


Note on A Valentine

"A Valentine," one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to have been written early in 1846.
Contents


Note on An Enigma

"An Enigma," addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewig ("Stella"), was sent to that lady in a letter, in November 1847, and the following March appeared in Sartain's Union Magazine.
Contents


Note on To My Mother

The sonnet, "To My Mother" (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to the short-lived Flag of our Union, early in 1849, but does not appear to have been issued until after its author's death, when it appeared in the Leaflets of Memory for 1850.
Contents


Note on For Annie

"For Annie" was first published in the Flag of our Union, in the spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the Home Journal.
Contents


Note on To F——

"To F——" (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the Broadway Journal for April 1845. These lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed "To Mary," in the Southern Literary Messenger for July 1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in Graham's Magazine for March 1842, as "To One Departed."
Contents


Note on To Frances S. Osgood

"To F—s S. O—d," a portion of the poet's triune tribute to Mrs. Osgood, was published in the Broadway Journal for September 1845. The earliest version of these lines appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger for September 1835, as "Lines written in an Album," and was addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor's daughter. Slightly revised, the poem reappeared in Burton's Gentleman's Magazine for August, 1839, as "To ——."
Contents


Note on Eldorado

Although "Eldorado" was published during Poe's lifetime, in 1849, in the Flag of our Union, it does not appear to have ever received the author's finishing touches.
Contents


Note on Eulalie

"Eulalie—a Song" first appears in Colton's American Review for July, 1845.
Contents


Note on A Dream within a Dream

"A Dream within a Dream" does not appear to have been published as a separate poem during its author's lifetime. A portion of it was contained, in 1829, in the piece beginning, "Should my early life seem," and in 1831 some few lines of it were used as a conclusion to "Tamerlane." In 1849 the poet sent a friend all but the first nine lines of the piece as a separate poem, headed "For Annie."
Contents


Note on To Marie Louise (Shew)

"To M—— L—— S——," addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, was written in February 1847, and published shortly afterwards. In the first posthumous collection of Poe's poems these lines were, for some reason, included in the "Poems written in Youth," and amongst those poems they have hitherto been included.
Contents


Note on the second poem entitled  To Marie Louise (Shew)

"To——," a second piece addressed to Mrs. Shew, and written in 1848, was also first published, but in a somewhat faulty form, in the above named posthumous collection.

Note on The City in the Sea

Under the title of "The Doomed City" the initial version of "The City in the Sea" appeared in the 1831 volume of Poems by Poe: it reappeared as "The City of Sin," in the Southern Literary Messenger for August 1835, whilst the present draft of it first appeared in Colton's American Review for April, 1845.

Poems of Manhood

Lenore

Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
Let the bell toll!—a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.
And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?—weep now or never more!
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
Come! let the burial rite be read—the funeral song be sung!—
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young—
A dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young.

"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her—that she died!
How shall the ritual, then, be read?—the requiem how be sung
By you—by yours, the evil eye,—by yours, the slanderous tongue
That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?"

Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
The sweet Lenore hath "gone before," with Hope, that flew beside,
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride—
For her, the fair and débonnaire, that now so lowly lies,
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes—
The life still there, upon her hair—the death upon her eyes.

"Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
But waft the angel on her flight with a pæan of old days!
Let no bell toll!—lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned Earth.
To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven—
From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven—
From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven."

To One in Paradise

Thou wast that all to me, love,
For which my soul did pine—
A green isle in the sea, love,
A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
And all the flowers were mine.

Ah, dream too bright to last!
Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
But to be overcast!
A voice from out the Future cries,
"On! on!"—but o'er the Past
(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!

For, alas! alas! with me
The light of Life is o'er!
"No more—no more—no more"—
(Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore)
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
Or the stricken eagle soar!

And all my days are trances,
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances,
And where thy footstep gleams—
In what ethereal dances,
By what eternal streams!

Alas! for that accursed time
They bore thee o'er the billow,
From love to titled age and crime,
And an unholy pillow!
From me, and from our misty clime,
Where weeps the silver willow!

The Coliseum

Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
Of lofty contemplation left to Time
By buried centuries of pomp and power!
At length—at length—after so many days
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
(Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
I feel ye now—I feel ye in your strength—
O spells more sure than e'er Judæan king
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
Lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

But stay! these walls—these ivy-clad arcades—
These mouldering plinths—these sad and blackened shafts—
These vague entablatures—this crumbling frieze—
These shattered cornices—this wreck—this ruin—
These stones—alas! these gray stones—are they all—
All of the famed, and the colossal left
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?

"Not all"—the Echoes answer me—"not all!
Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
As melody from Memnon to the Sun.
We rule the hearts of mightiest men—we rule
With a despotic sway all giant minds.
We are not impotent—we pallid stones.
Not all our power is gone—not all our fame—
Not all the magic of our high renown—
Not all the wonder that encircles us—
Not all the mysteries that in us lie—
Not all the memories that hang upon
And cling around about us as a garment,
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory."

The Haunted Palace

In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace—
Radiant palace—reared its head.
In the monarch Thought's dominion—
It stood there!
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair!

Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
On its roof did float and flow,
(This—all this—was in the olden
Time long ago),
And every gentle air that dallied,
In that sweet day,
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
A winged odor went away.

Wanderers in that happy valley,
Through two luminous windows, saw
Spirits moving musically,
To a lute's well-tunëd law,
Bound about a throne where, sitting
(Porphyrogene!)
In state his glory well befitting,
The ruler of the realm was seen.

And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door,
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
And sparkling evermore,
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
Was but to sing,
In voices of surpassing beauty,
The wit and wisdom of their king.

But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
Assailed the monarch's high estate.
(Ah, let us mourn!—for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate !)
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed,
Is but a dim-remembered story
Of the old time entombed.

And travellers, now, within that valley,
Through the red-litten windows see
Vast forms, that move fantastically
To a discordant melody,
While, like a ghastly rapid river,
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh—but smile no more.

The Conqueror Worm

Lo! 'tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years!
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
In veils, and drowned in tears,
Sit in a theatre, to see
A play of hopes and fears,
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres.

Mimes, in the form of God on high,
Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither fly—
Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro,
Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible Wo!

That motley drama—oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its Phantom chased for evermore,
By a crowd that seize it not,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self-same spot,
And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
And Horror the soul of the plot.

But see, amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude!
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food,
And the angels sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued.

Out—out are the lights—out all!
And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm,
And the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, "Man,"
And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

Silence

There are some qualities—some incorporate things,
That have a double life, which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
There is a twofold Silence—sea and shore—
Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
Some human memories and tearful lore,
Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man), commend thyself to God!

Dreamland

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named Night,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule—
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
Out of Space—out of Time.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the dews that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters—lone and dead,
Their still waters—still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.

By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,—

By the mountains—near the river
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—
By the gray woods,—by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp,—
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the Ghouls,—
By each spot the most unholy—
In each nook most melancholy,—

There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the past—
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by—
White-robed forms of friends long given,
In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.

For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful, soothing region—
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tis—oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it,
May not—dare not openly view it;
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its King, who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid;
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only.
Where an Eidolon, named Night,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule.

To Zante

Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
How many memories of what radiant hours
At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
How many scenes of what departed bliss!
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
How many visions of a maiden that is
No more—no more upon thy verdant slopes!

No more! alas, that magical sad sound
Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more—
Thy memory no more! Accursed ground
Henceforward I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!

Hymn

At morn—at noon—at twilight dim—
Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
In joy and wo—in good and ill—
Mother of God, be with me still!
When the Hours flew brightly by,
And not a cloud obscured the sky,
My soul, lest it should truant be,
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
Darkly my Present and my Past,
Let my future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine!

Scenes from Politian

an unpublished drama

I

ROME — a Hall in a Palace. ALESSANDRA and CASTIGLIONE.



Alessandra	Thou art sad, Castiglione.
Castiglione	Sad!—not I.
Oh, I'm the happiest, happiest man in Rome!
A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,
Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!
Alessandra	Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
Thy happiness—what ails thee, cousin of mine?
Why didst thou sigh so deeply?
Castiglione	Did I sigh?
I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,
A silly—a most silly fashion I have
When I am very happy. Did I sigh? [sighing]
Alessandra	Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.
Late hours and wine, Castiglione,—these
Will ruin thee! thou art already altered—
Thy looks are haggard—nothing so wears away
The constitution as late hours and wine.
Castiglione (musing)	Nothing, fair cousin, nothing—
Not even deep sorrow—
Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
I will amend.
Alessandra	Do it! I would have thee drop
Thy riotous company, too—fellows low born
Ill suit the like of old Di Broglio's heir
And Alessandra's husband.
Castiglione	I will drop them.
Alessandra	Thou wilt—thou must. Attend thou also more
To thy dress and equipage—they are over plain
For thy lofty rank and fashion—much depends
Upon appearances.
Castiglione	I'll see to it.
Alessandra	Then see to it!—pay more attention, sir,
To a becoming carriage—much thou wantest
In dignity.
Castiglione	Much, much, oh, much I want
In proper dignity.
Alessandra (haughtily)	Thou mockest me, sir!
Castiglione (abstractedly)	Sweet, gentle Lalage!
Alessandra	Heard I aright?
I speak to him—he speaks of Lalage?
Sir Count!
[places her hand on his shoulder]
what art thou dreaming?
He's not well!
What ails thee, sir?
Castiglione (starting)	Cousin! fair cousin!—madam!
I crave thy pardon—indeed I am not well—
Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.
This air is most oppressive!—Madam—the Duke!
Enter Di Broglio
Di Broglio	My son, I've news for thee!—hey!—what's the matter?
[observing Alessandra].
I' the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,
You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!
I've news for you both. Politian is expected
Hourly in Rome—Politian, Earl of Leicester!
We'll have him at the wedding. 'Tis his first visit
To the imperial city.
Alessandra	What! Politian
Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?
Di Broglio	The same, my love.
We'll have him at the wedding. A man quite young
In years, but gray in fame. I have not seen him,
But Rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy
Pre-eminent in arts, and arms, and wealth,
And high descent. We'll have him at the wedding.
Alessandra	I have heard much of this Politian.
Gay, volatile and giddy—is he not,
And little given to thinking?
Di Broglio	Far from it, love.
No branch, they say, of all philosophy
So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.
Learned as few are learned.
Alessandra	'Tis very strange!
I have known men have seen Politian
And sought his company. They speak of him
As of one who entered madly into life,
Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.
Castiglione	Ridiculous! Now I have seen Politian
And know him well—nor learned nor mirthful he.
He is a dreamer, and shut out
From common passions.
Di Broglio	Children, we disagree.
Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear
Politian was a melancholy man?
[Exeunt]

ROME.—A Lady's Apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden. LALAGE, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and a hand-mirror. In the background JACINTA (a servant maid) leans carelessly upon a chair.

Lalage	Jacinta! is it thou?
Jacinta (pertly)	Yes, ma'am, I'm here.
Lalage	I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting.
Sit down!—let not my presence trouble you—
Sit down!—for I am humble, most humble.
Jacinta (aside)	'Tis time.
(Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting her elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look. Lalage continues to read.)
Lalage	"It in another climate, so he said,
Bore a bright golden flower, but not i' this soil!"
[pauses—turns over some leaves and resumes.]
"No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower—
But Ocean ever to refresh mankind
Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind"
Oh, beautiful!—most beautiful!—how like
To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!
O happy land! [pauses] She died!—the maiden died!
O still more happy maiden who couldst die!
Jacinta!
[Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes,]
Again!—a similar tale
Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play—
"She died full young"—one Bossola answers him—
"I think not so—her infelicity
Seemed to have years too many"—Ah, luckless lady!
Jacinta! [still no answer.]
Here's a far sterner story—
But like—oh, very like in its despair—
Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily
A thousand hearts—losing at length her own.
She died. Thus endeth the history—and her maids
Lean over her and keep—two gentle maids
With gentle names—Eiros and Charmion!
Rainbow and Dove!—Jacinta!
Jacinta (pettishly)	Madam, what is it?
Lalage	Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind
As go down in the library and bring me
The Holy Evangelists?
Jacinta	Pshaw!
[Exit]
Lalage	If there be balm
For the wounded spirit in Gilead, it is there!
Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
Will there be found—"dew sweeter far than that
Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill."
[re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table]
Jacinta
(aside)	There, ma'am, 's the book.
Indeed she is very troublesome.
Lalage (astonished)	What didst thou say, Jacinta?
Have I done aught
To grieve thee or to vex thee?—I am sorry.
For thou hast served me long and ever been
Trustworthy and respectful.
[resumes her reading.]
Jacinta (aside)	I can't believe
She has any more jewels—no—no—she gave me all.
Lalage	What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me
Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.
How fares good Ugo?—and when is it to be?
Can I do aught?—is there no further aid
Thou needest, Jacinta?
Jacinta (aside)	Is there no further aid!
That's meant for me.
[aloud]
I'm sure, madam, you need not
Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.
Lalage	Jewels! Jacinta,—now indeed, Jacinta, I thought not of the jewels.
Jacinta	Oh, perhaps not!
But then I might have sworn it. After all,
There's Ugo says the ring is only paste,
For he's sure the Count Castiglione never
Would have given a real diamond to such as you;
And at the best I'm certain, madam, you cannot
Have use for jewels now. But I might have sworn it.
[Exit]
[Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table—after a short pause raises it.]
Lalage	Poor Lalage!—and is it come to this?
Thy servant maid!—but courage!—'tis but a viper
Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!
[taking up the mirror]
Ha! here at least's a friend—too much a friend
In earlier days—a friend will not deceive thee.
Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)
A tale—a pretty tale—and heed thou not
Though it be rife with woe. It answers me.
It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,
And beauty long deceased—remembers me,
Of Joy departed—Hope, the Seraph Hope,
Inurned and entombed!—now, in a tone
Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,
Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true!—thou liest not!
Thou hast no end to gain—no heart to break—
Castiglione lied who said he loved——
Thou true—he false!—false!—false!
[While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment and approaches unobserved.]
Monk	Refuge thou hast,
Sweet daughter! in Heaven. Think of eternal things!
Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!
Lalage (arising hurriedly)	I cannot pray!—My soul is at war with God!
The frightful sounds of merriment below;
Disturb my senses—go! I cannot pray—
The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
Thy presence grieves me—go!—thy priestly raiment
Fills me with dread—thy ebony crucifix
With horror and awe!
Monk	Think of thy precious soul!
Lalage	Think of my early days!—think of my father
And mother in Heaven! think of our quiet home,
And the rivulet that ran before the door!
Think of my little sisters!—think of them!
And think of me!—think of my trusting love
And confidence—his vows—my ruin—think—think
Of my unspeakable misery!——begone!
Yet stay! yet stay!—what was it thou saidst of prayer
And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith
And vows before the throne?
Monk	I did.
Lalage	'Tis well.
There is a vow 'twere fitting should be made—
A sacred vow, imperative and urgent,
A solemn vow!
Monk	Daughter, this zeal is well!
Lalage	Father, this zeal is anything but well!
Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
A crucifix whereon to register
This sacred vow? [he hands her his own.]
Not that—Oh! no!—no!—no [shuddering.]
Not that! Not that!—I tell thee, holy man,
Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!
Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,—
I have a crucifix! Methinks 'twere fitting
The deed—the vow—the symbol of the deed—
And the deed's register should tally, father!
[draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high.]
Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
Is written in heaven!
Monk	Thy words are madness, daughter,
And speak a purpose unholy—thy lips are livid—
Thine eyes are wild—tempt not the wrath divine!
Pause ere too late!—oh, be not—be not rash!
Swear not the oath—oh, swear it not!
Lalage	'Tis sworn!



III

An Apartment in a Palace. POLITIAN and BALDAZZAR.

Baldazzar	Arouse thee now, Politian!
Thou must not—nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not
Give way unto these humors. Be thyself!
Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee
And live, for now thou diest!
Politian	Not so, Baldazzar!
Surely I live!
Baldazzar	Politian, it doth grieve me
To see thee thus!
Politian	Baldazzar, it doth grieve me
To give thee cause for grief, my honored friend.
Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?
At thy behest I will shake off that nature
Which from my forefathers I did inherit,
Which with my mother's milk I did imbibe,
And be no more Politian, but some other.
Command me, sir!
Baldazzar	To the field then—to the field—
To the senate or the field.
Politian	Alas! alas!
There is an imp would follow me even there!
There is an imp hath followed me even there!
There is—what voice was that?
Baldazzar	I heard it not.
I heard not any voice except thine own,
And the echo of thine own.
Politian	Then I but dreamed.
Baldazzar	Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp—the court
Befit thee—Fame awaits thee—Glory calls—
And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
In hearkening to imaginary sounds
And phantom voices.
Politian	It is a phantom voice!
Didst thou not hear it then?
Baldazzar	I heard it not.
Politian	Thou heardst it not!—Baldazzar, speak no more
To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.
Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,
Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile
We have been boys together—school-fellows—
And now are friends—yet shall not be so long—
For in the Eternal City thou shalt do me
A kind and gentle office, and a Power—
A Power august, benignant, and supreme—
Shall then absolve thee of all further duties
Unto thy friend.
Baldazzar	Thou speakest a fearful riddle
I will not understand.
Politian	Yet now as Fate
Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,
The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,
And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!
I cannot die, having within my heart
So keen a relish for the beautiful
As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air
Is balmier now than it was wont to be—
Rich melodies are floating in the winds—
A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth—
And with a holier lustre the quiet moon
Sitteth in Heaven.—Hist! hist! thou canst not say
Thou hearest not now, Baldazzar?
Baldazzar	Indeed I hear not.
Politian	Not hear it!—listen—now—listen!—the faintest sound
And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!
A lady's voice!—and sorrow in the tone!
Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!
Again!—again!—how solemnly it falls
Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice
Surely I never heard—yet it were well
Had I but heard it with its thrilling tones
In earlier days!
Baldazzar	I myself hear it now.
Be still!—the voice, if I mistake not greatly,
Proceeds from younder lattice—which you may see
Very plainly through the window—it belongs,
Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.
The singer is undoubtedly beneath
The roof of his Excellency—and perhaps
Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke
As the betrothed of Castiglione,
His son and heir.
Politian	Be still!—it comes again!
Voice (very faintly)	"And is thy heart so strong1
As for to leave me thus,
That have loved thee so long,
In wealth and woe among?
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus?
Say nay! say nay!"
Baldazzar	The song is English, and I oft have heard it
In merry England—never so plaintively—
Hist! hist! it comes again!
Voice (more loudly)	"Is it so strong
As for to leave me thus,
That have loved thee so long,
In wealth and woe among?
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus?
Say nay! say nay!"
Baldazzar	'Tis hushed and all is still!
Politian	All is not still.
Baldazzar	Let us go down.
Politian	Go down, Baldazzar, go!
Baldazzar	The hour is growing late—the Duke awaits us,—
Thy presence is expected in the hall
Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?
Voice (distinctly)	"Who have loved thee so long,
In wealth and woe among,
And is thy heart so strong?
Say nay! say nay!"
Baldazzar	Let us descend!—'tis time. Politian, give
These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,
Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness
Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember!
Politian	Remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.[going].
Let us descend. Believe me I would give,
Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice—
"To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear
Once more that silent tongue."
Baldazzar	Let me beg you, sir,
Descend with me—the Duke may be offended.
Let us go down, I pray you.
Voice (loudly)	Say nay!—say nay!
Politian (aside)	'Tis strange!—'tis very strange—methought the voice
Chimed in with my desires and bade me stay!
[Approaching the window]
Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.
Now be this fancy, by heaven, or be it Fate,
Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make
Apology unto the Duke for me;
I go not down to-night.
Baldazzar	Your lordship's pleasure
Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.
Politian	Good-night, my friend, good-night.



IV

The Gardens of a Palace—Moonlight. LALAGE and POLITIAN.

Lalage	And dost thou speak of love
To me, Politian?—dost thou speak of love
To Lalage?—ah woe—ah woe is me!
This mockery is most cruel—most cruel indeed!
Politian	Weep not! oh, sob not thus!—thy bitter tears
Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage—
Be comforted! I know—I know it all,
And still I speak of love. Look at me, brightest,
And beautiful Lalage!—turn here thine eyes!
Thou askest me if I could speak of love,
Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen
Thou askest me that—and thus I answer thee—
Thus on my bended knee I answer thee. [kneeling]
Sweet Lalage, I love thee—love thee—love thee;
Thro' good and ill—thro' weal and woe, I love thee.
Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,
Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.
Not on God's altar, in any time or clime,
Burned there a holier fire than burneth now
Within my spirit for thee. And do I love?
[arising]
Even for thy woes I love thee—even for thy woes—
Thy beauty and thy woes.
Lalage	Alas, proud Earl,
Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!
How, in thy father's halls, among the maidens
Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,
Could the dishonored Lalage abide?
Thy wife, and with a tainted memory—
My seared and blighted name, how would it tally
With the ancestral honors of thy house,
And with thy glory?
Politian	Speak not to me of glory!
I hate—I loathe the name; I do abhor
The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.
Art thou not Lalage, and I Politian?
Do I not love—art thou not beautiful—
What need we more? Ha! glory! now speak not of it:
By all I hold most sacred and most solemn—
By all my wishes now—my fears hereafter—
By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven—
There is no deed I would more glory in,
Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
And trample it under foot. What matters it—
What matters it, my fairest, and my best,
That we go down unhonored and forgotten
Into the dust—so we descend together?
Descend together—and then—and then perchance—
Lalage	Why dost thou pause, Politian?
Politian	And then perchance
Arise together, Lalage, and roam
The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,
And still—
Lalage	Why dost thou pause, Politian?
Politian	And still together—together.
Lalage	Now, Earl of Leicester!
Thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts
I feel thou lovest me truly.
Politian	O Lalage!
[throwing himself upon his knee.]
And lovest thou me?
Lalage	Hist! hush! within the gloom
Of yonder trees methought a figure passed—
A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless—
Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.
[walks across and returns]
I was mistaken—'twas but a giant bough
Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!
Politian	My Lalage—my love! why art thou moved?
Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience self,
Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,
Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind
Is chilly—and these melancholy boughs
Throw over all things a gloom.
Lalage	Politian!
Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land
With which all tongues are busy—a land new found—
Miraculously found by one of Genoa—
A thousand leagues within the golden west?
A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,—
And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,
And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds
Of Heaven untrammelled flow—which air to breathe
Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter
In days that are to come?
Politian	Oh, wilt thou—wilt thou
Fly to that Paradise—my Lalage, wilt thou
Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,
And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.
And life shall then be mine, for I will live
For thee, and in thine eyes—and thou shalt be
No more a mourner—but the radiant Joys
Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope
Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee
And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,
My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,
My all;—oh, wilt thou—wilt thou, Lalage,
Fly thither with me?
Lalage	A deed is to be done—
Castiglione lives!
Politian	And he shall die!
[Exit]
Lalage (after a pause)	And—he—shall—die!—alas!
Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?
Where am I?—what was it he said?—Politian!
Thou art not gone—thou art not gone, Politian!
I feel thou art not gone—yet dare not look,
Lest I behold thee not—thou couldst not go
With those words upon thy lips—oh, speak to me!
And let me hear thy voice—one word—one word,
To say thou art not gone,—one little sentence,
To say how thou dost scorn—how thou dost hate
My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou art not gone—
Oh, speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!
I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go.
Villain, thou art not gone—thou mockest me!
And thus I clutch thee—thus!—He is gone, he is gone—
Gone—gone. Where am I?—'tis well—'tis very well!
So that the blade be keen—the blow be sure,
'Tis well, 'tis very well—alas! alas!



V

The Suburbs. POLITIAN alone.

Politian	This weakness grows upon me. I am fain
And much I fear me ill—it will not do
To die ere I have lived!—Stay—stay thy hand,
O Azrael, yet awhile!—Prince of the Powers
Of Darkness and the Tomb, oh, pity me!
Oh, pity me! let me not perish now,
In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!
Give me to live yet—yet a little while:
'Tis I who pray for life—I who so late
Demanded but to die!—What sayeth the Count?
[Enter Baldazzar]
Baldazzar	That, knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
Between the Earl Politian and himself,
He doth decline your cartel.
Politian	What didst thou say?
What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?
With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
Laden from yonder bowers!—a fairer day,
Or one more worthy Italy, methinks
No mortal eyes have seen!—what said the Count?
Baldazzar	That he, Castiglione, not being aware
Of any feud existing, or any cause
Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,
Cannot accept the challenge.
Politian	It is most true—
All this is very true. When saw you, sir,
When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid
Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,
A heaven so calm as this—so utterly free
From the evil taint of clouds?—and he did say?
Baldazzar	No more, my lord, than I have told you:
The Count Castiglione will not fight.
Having no cause for quarrel.
Politian	Now this is true—
All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,
And I have not forgotten it—thou'lt do me
A piece of service: wilt thou go back and say
Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,
Hold him a villain?—thus much, I pr'ythee, say
Unto the Count—it is exceeding just
He should have cause for quarrel.
Baldazzar	My lord!—my friend!—
Politian (aside)	'Tis he—he comes himself!
[aloud] Thou reasonest well.
I know what thou wouldst say—not send the message—
Well!—I will think of it—I will not send it.
Now pr'ythee, leave me—hither doth come a person
With whom affairs of a most private nature
I would adjust.
Baldazzar	I go—to-morrow we meet,
Do we not?—at the Vatican.
Politian	At the Vatican.
[Exit Baldazzar]
[Enter Castiglione]
Castiglione	The Earl of Leicester here!
Politian	I am the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,
Dost thou not, that I am here?
Castiglione	My lord, some strange,
Some singular mistake—misunderstanding—
Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged
Thereby, in heat of anger, to address
Some words most unaccountable, in writing,
To me, Castiglione; the bearer being
Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware
Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,
Having given thee no offence. Ha!—am I right?
'Twas a mistake?—undoubtedly—we all
Do err at times.
Politian	Draw, villain, and prate no more!
Castiglione	Ha!—draw?—and villain? have at thee then at once,
Proud Earl!
[Draws.]
Politian	Thus to the expiatory tomb,
Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee
In the name of Lalage!
Castiglione
(letting fall his sword and recoiling
to the extremity of the stage)	Of Lalage!
Hold off—thy sacred hand!—avaunt, I say!
Avaunt—I will not fight thee—indeed I dare not.
Politian	Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?
Shall I be baffled thus?—now this is well;
Didst say thou darest not? Ha!
Castiglione	I dare not—dare not—
Hold off thy hand—with that beloved name
So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee—
I cannot—dare not.
Politian	Now, by my halidom,
I do believe thee!—coward, I do believe thee!
Castiglione	Ha!—coward!—this may not be!
[clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his purpose is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon his knee at the feet of the Earl]
Alas! my lord,
It is—it is—most true. In such a cause
I am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!
Politian (greatly softened)	Alas!—I do—indeed I pity thee.
Castiglione	And Lalage—
Politian	Scoundrel!—arise and die!
Castiglione	It needeth not be—thus—thus—Oh, let me die
Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting
That in this deep humiliation I perish.
For in the fight I will not raise a hand
Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home—
[baring his bosom]
Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon—
Strike home. I will not fight thee.
Politian	Now's Death and Hell!
Am I not—am I not sorely—grievously tempted
To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:
Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare
For public insult in the streets—before
The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee—
Like an avenging spirit I'll follow thee
Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest—
Before all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,—I'll taunt thee,
Dost hear? with cowardice—thou wilt not fight me?
Thou liest! thou shalt!
[Exit]
Castiglione	Now this indeed is just!
Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!

Note on Politian

Such portions of "Politian" as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the Southern Literary Messenger for December 1835 and January 1836, being styled "Scenes from Politian; an unpublished drama." These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845 collection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not considered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hasty and unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor; and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of Castiglione her betrothed.

Duke	Why do you laugh?
Castiglione	Indeed.
I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not
On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?
Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.
Alessandra, you and I, you must remember!
We were walking in the garden.
Duke	Perfectly.
I do remember it—what of it—what then?
Castiglione	O nothing—nothing at all.
Duke	Nothing at all!
It is most singular that you should laugh
At nothing at all!
Castiglione	Most singular—singular!
Duke	Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind
As tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.
What are you talking of?
Castiglione	Was it not so?
We differed in opinion touching him.
Duke	Him!—Whom?
Castiglione	Why, sir, the Earl Politian.
Duke	The Earl of Leicester! Yes!—is it he you mean?
We differed, indeed. If I now recollect
The words you used were that the Earl you knew
Was neither learned nor mirthful.
Castiglione	Ha! ha!—now did I?
Duke	That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time
You were wrong, it being not the character
Of the Earl—whom all the world allows to be
A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,
Too positive again.
Castiglione	'Tis singular!
Most singular! I could not think it possible
So little time could so much alter one!
To say the truth about an hour ago,
As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,
All arm in arm, we met this very man
The Earl—he, with his friend Baldazzar,
Having just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he is altered!
Such an account he gave me of his journey!
'Twould have made you die with laughter—such tales he told
Of his caprices and his merry freaks
Along the road—such oddity—such humor—
Such wit—such whim—such flashes of wild merriment
Set off too in such full relief by the grave
Demeanor of his friend—who, to speak the truth
Was gravity itself—
Duke	Did I not tell you?
Castiglione	You did—and yet 'tis strange! but true, as strange,
How much I was mistaken! I always thought
The Earl a gloomy man.
Duke	So, so, you see!
Be not too positive. Whom have we here?
It cannot be the Earl?
Castiglione	The Earl! Oh no!
Tis not the Earl—but yet it is—and leaning
Upon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!
[Enter Politian and Baldazzar.]
My lord, a second welcome let me give you
To Rome—his Grace the Duke of Broglio.
Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl
Of Leicester in Great Britain.
[Politian bows haughtily.]
That, his friend
Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,
So please you, for Your Grace.
Duke	Ha! ha! Most welcome
To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!
And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!
I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.
Castiglione! call your cousin hither,
And let me make the noble Earl acquainted
With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time
Most seasonable. The wedding—
Politian	Touching those letters, sir,
Your son made mention of—your son, is he not?—
Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.
If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here—
Baldazzar! ah!—my friend Baldazzar here
Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.
Duke	Retire!—so soon?
Castiglione	What ho! Benito! Rupert!
His lordship's chambers—show his lordship to them!
His lordship is unwell.
[Enter Benito]
Benito	This way, my lord!
[Exit, followed by Politian.]
Duke	Retire! Unwell!
Baldazzar	So please you, sir. I fear me
'Tis as you say—his lordship is unwell.
The damp air of the evening—the fatigue
Of a long journey—the—indeed I had better
Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.
I will return anon.
Duke	Return anon!
Now this is very strange! Castiglione!
This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.
You surely were mistaken in what you said
Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!—which of us said
Politian was a melancholy man?
[Exeunt.]

Poems of Youth

Introduction (1831)

Letter to Mr. B——

West Point, 1831


Dear B——

...

Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second edition—that small portion I thought it as well to include in the present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined 'Al Aaraaf' and 'Tamerlane' with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor have I hesitated to insert from the 'Minor Poems,' now omitted, whole lines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some chance of being seen by posterity.

"It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and mine of poetry, I feel to be false—the less poetical the critic, the less just the critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few B——s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world's good opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe,
'Shakespeare is in possession of the world's good opinion, and yet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?'
The difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word 'judgment' or 'opinion.' The opinion is the world's, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet—yet the fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool's neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean his every-day actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never have been discovered—this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet—the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his opinion. This neighbor's own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle.

"You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer. He is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law or empire—an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors, improve by travel—their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so many letters of recommendation.

"I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet would, I grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not, I think, fail of making a just critique; whatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false criticism than of just where one's own writings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good. There are, of course, many objections to what I say: Milton is a great example of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the 'Paradise Regained' is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. But, in fact, the 'Paradise Regained' is little, if at all, inferior to the 'Paradise Lost,' and is only supposed so to be because men do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second.

"I dare say Milton preferred 'Comus' to either —if so—justly.

"As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern history—the heresy of what is called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplified.

"Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writings—but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is, or should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence, everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness. Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is another name for pleasure;—therefore the end of instruction should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the reverse.

"To proceed: ceteris paribus, he who pleases is of more importance to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining.

"I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in 'Melmoth,' who labors indefatigably, through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.

"Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study—not a passion—it becomes the metaphysician to reason—but the poet to protest. Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and learning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my heart, that learning has little to do with the imagination—intellect with the passions—or age with poetry.
"'Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;
He who would search for pearls must dive below,'
"are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths, men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought—not in the palpable palaces where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding the goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith—that moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of a man.

"We see an instance of Coleridge's liability to err, in his Biographia Literaria—professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a treatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. He goes wrong by reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray—while he who surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is useful to us below—its brilliancy and its beauty.

"As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the feelings of a poet I believe—for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writings—(and delicacy is the poet's own kingdom—his El Dorado)—but they have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier.

"He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently is too correct. This may not be understood,—but the old Goths of Germany would have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober—sober that they might not be deficient in formality—drunk lest they should be destitute of vigor.

"The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at random)—'Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done, and what was never done before;'—indeed? then it follows that in doing what is unworthy to be done, or what has been done before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington, the pick-pocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with William Wordsworth, the poet.

"Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be Ossian's or Macpherson's can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in the controversy. Tantæne animis? Can great minds descend to such absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise. It is the beginning of the epic poem 'Temora.' 'The blue waves of Ullin roll in light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads in the breeze.' And this—this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is alive and panting with immortality—this, William Wordsworth, the author of 'Peter Bell,' has selected for his contempt. We shall see what better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:
"'And now she's at the pony's tail,
And now she's at the pony's head,
On that side now, and now on this;
And, almost stifled with her bliss,
A few sad tears does Betty shed....
She pats the pony, where or when
She knows not ... happy Betty Foy!
Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!'
"Secondly:
"'The dew was falling fast, the—stars began to blink;
I heard a voice: it said,—"Drink, pretty creature, drink!"
And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied
A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side.
No other sheep was near, the lamb was all alone,
And by a slender cord was tether'd to a stone.'
"Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we will believe it, indeed we will, Mr, W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? I love a sheep from the bottom of my heart. "But there are occasions, dear B——, there are occasions when even Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an extract from his preface:
"'Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers, if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion (impossible!) will, no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha! ha! ha!) they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to assume that title.' Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
"Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and the bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.

"Of Coleridge, I cannot speak but with reverence. His towering intellect! his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself,
'J'ai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce qu'elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles nient;'
and to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the Nyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone. In reading that man's poetry, I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, conscious from the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and the light that are weltering below.

"What is Poetry?—Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! 'Give me,' I demanded of a scholar some time ago, 'give me a definition of poetry.' 'Très-volontiers;' and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr. Johnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal Shakespeare! I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B——, think of poetry, and then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy; think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then—and then think of the 'Tempest'—the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'— Prospero—Oberon—and Titania!

"A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for its immediate object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for its object, an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure, being a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting perceptible images with definite, poetry with indefinite sensations, to which end music is an essential, since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a pleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music; the idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.

"What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul?

"To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B——, what you, no doubt, perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign contempt. That they have followers proves nothing:
"'No Indian prince has to his palace
More followers than a thief to the gallows.'"

Sonnet — to Science

Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
Vulture, whose wings are dull realities
How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing!
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star?
Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?

1829

Al Aaraf1

I	O! nothing earthly save the ray
(Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,
As in those gardens where the day
Springs from the gems of Circassy—
O! nothing earthly save the thrill
Of melody in woodland rill—
Or (music of the passion-hearted)
Joy's voice so peacefully departed
That like the murmur in the shell,
Its echo dwelleth and will dwell—
O! nothing of the dross of ours—
Yet all the beauty—all the flowers
That list our Love, and deck our bowers—
Adorn yon world afar, afar—
The wandering star.

'Twas a sweet time for Nesace—for there
Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
Near four bright suns—a temporary rest—
An oasis in desert of the blest.
Away away—'mid seas of rays that roll
Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul—
The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
Can struggle to its destin'd eminence—
To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
And late to ours, the favour'd one of God—
But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,
She throws aside the sceptre—leaves the helm,
And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
Whence sprang the "Idea of Beauty" into birth,
(Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,
Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,
It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt),
She look'd into Infinity—and knelt.
Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled—
Fit emblems of the model of her world—
Seen but in beauty—not impeding sight—
Of other beauty glittering thro' the light—
A wreath that twined each starry form around,
And all the opal'd air in color bound.

All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head
On the fair Capo Deucato2, and sprang
So eagerly around about to hang
Upon the flying footsteps of—deep pride—
Of her who lov'd a mortal—and so died3.
The Sephalica, budding with young bees,
Uprear'd its purple stem around her knees:
And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd4—
Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd
All other loveliness: its honied dew
(The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven,
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
In Trebizond—and on a sunny flower
So like its own above that, to this hour,
It still remaineth, torturing the bee
With madness, and unwonted reverie:
In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
Disconsolate linger—grief that hangs her head,
Repenting follies that full long have fled,
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair:
Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
And Clytia5 pondering between many a sun,
While pettish tears adown her petals run:
And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth6—
And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:
And Valisnerian lotus thither flown7
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante8!
Isola d'oro!—Fior di Levante!
And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever9
With Indian Cupid down the holy river—
Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given
To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven:10

"Spirit! that dwellest where,
In the deep sky,
The terrible and fair,
In beauty vie!
Beyond the line of blue—
The boundary of the star
Which turneth at the view
Of thy barrier and thy bar—
Of the barrier overgone
By the comets who were cast
From their pride, and from their throne
To be drudges till the last—
To be carriers of fire
(The red fire of their heart)
With speed that may not tire
And with pain that shall not part—
Who livest—that we know—
In Eternity—we feel—
But the shadow of whose brow
What spirit shall reveal?
Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,
Thy messenger hath known
Have dream'd for thy Infinity
A model of their own11—
Thy will is done, O God!
The star hath ridden high
Thro' many a tempest, but she rode
Beneath thy burning eye;
And here, in thought, to thee—
In thought that can alone
Ascend thy empire and so be
A partner of thy throne—
By winged Fantasy12,
My embassy is given,
Till secrecy shall knowledge be
In the environs of Heaven.

She ceas'd—and buried then her burning cheek
Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek
A shelter from the fervor of His eye;
For the stars trembled at the Deity.
She stirr'd not—breath'd not—for a voice was there
How solemnly pervading the calm air!
A sound of silence on the startled ear
Which dreamy poets name "the music of the sphere."
Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
"Silence"—which is the merest word of all.

All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things
Flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings—
But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high
The eternal voice of God is passing by,
And the red winds are withering in the sky!
"What tho' in worlds which sightless cycles run13,
Link'd to a little system, and one sun—
Where all my love is folly, and the crowd
Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath
(Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)
What tho' in worlds which own a single sun
The sands of time grow dimmer as they run,
Yet thine is my resplendency, so given
To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven.
Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
With all thy train, athwart the moony sky—
Apart—like fire-flies in Sicilian night14,
And wing to other worlds another light!
Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
To the proud orbs that twinkle—and so be
To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban
Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!"

Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
The single-mooned eve!-on earth we plight
Our faith to one love—and one moon adore—
The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours,
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain
Her way—but left not yet her Therasæan reign15.
II	High on a mountain of enamell'd head—
Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
With many a mutter'd "hope to be forgiven"
What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven—
Of rosy head, that towering far away
Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
Of sunken suns at eve—at noon of night,
While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light—
Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall16
Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution, while they die—
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,
Sat gently on these columns as a crown—
A window of one circular diamond, there,
Look'd out above into the purple air
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,
Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring,
Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world: that grayish green
That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave
Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave—
And every sculptured cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling peered out,
Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche—
Achaian statues in a world so rich?
Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis17—
From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
Of beautiful Gomorrah! Oh, the wave18
Is now upon thee—but too late to save!
Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
Witness the murmur of the gray twilight
That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco19,
Of many a wild star-gazer long ago—
That stealeth ever on the ear of him
Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
And sees the darkness coming as a cloud—
Is not its form—its voice—most palpable and loud?20
But what is this?—it cometh—and it brings
A music with it—'tis the rush of wings—
A pause—and then a sweeping, falling strain,
And Nesace is in her halls again.
From the wild energy of wanton haste
Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
The zone that clung around her gentle waist
Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
Within the centre of that hall to breathe
She paus'd and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,
The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there!

Young flowers were whispering in melody21
To happy flowers that night—and tree to tree;
Fountains were gushing music as they fell
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell;
Yet silence came upon material things—
Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings—
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

"Neath blue-bell or streamer—
Or tufted wild spray
That keeps, from the dreamer,
The moonbeam away—22
Bright beings! that ponder,
With half-closing eyes,
On the stars which your wonder
Hath drawn from the skies,
Till they glance thro' the shade, and
Come down to your brow
Like—eyes of the maiden
Who calls on you now—
Arise! from your dreaming
In violet bowers,
To duty beseeming
These star-litten hours—
And shake from your tresses
Encumber'd with dew

The breath of those kisses
That cumber them too—
(O! how, without you, Love!
Could angels be blest?)
Those kisses of true love
That lull'd ye to rest!
Up! shake from your wing
Each hindering thing:
The dew of the night—
It would weigh down your flight;
And true love caresses—
O! leave them apart!
They are light on the tresses,
But lead on the heart.

Ligeia! Ligeia!
My beautiful one!
Whose harshest idea
Will to melody run,
O! is it thy will
On the breezes to toss?
Or, capriciously still,
Like the lone Albatross,23
Incumbent on night
(As she on the air)
To keep watch with delight
On the harmony there?

Ligeia! wherever
Thy image may be,
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee.
Thou hast bound many eyes
In a dreamy sleep—
But the strains still arise
Which thy vigilance keep—

The sound of the rain
Which leaps down to the flower,
And dances again
In the rhythm of the shower—
The murmur that springs24
From the growing of grass
Are the music of things—
But are modell'd, alas!
Away, then, my dearest,
O! hie thee away
To springs that lie clearest
Beneath the moon-ray—
To lone lake that smiles,
In its dream of deep rest,
At the many star-isles
That enjewel its breast—
Where wild flowers, creeping,
Have mingled their shade,
On its margin is sleeping
Full many a maid—
Some have left the cool glade, and
Have slept with the bee—25
Arouse them, my maiden,
On moorland and lea—

Go! breathe on their slumber,
All softly in ear,
The musical number
They slumber'd to hear—
For what can awaken
An angel so soon
Whose sleep hath been taken
Beneath the cold moon,
As the spell which no slumber
Of witchery may test,
The rhythmical number
Which lull'd him to rest?"

Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight—
Seraphs in all but "Knowledge," the keen light
That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds afar,
O death! from eye of God upon that star;
Sweet was that error—sweeter still that death—
Sweet was that error—ev'n with us the breath
Of Science dims the mirror of our joy—
To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy—
For what (to them) availeth it to know
That Truth is Falsehood—or that Bliss is Woe?
Sweet was their death—with them to die was rife
With the last ecstasy of satiate life—
Beyond that death no immortality—
But sleep that pondereth and is not "to be"—
And there—oh! may my weary spirit dwell—
Apart from Heaven's Eternity—and yet how far from Hell!26

What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
But two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts
To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover—
O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?
Unguided Love hath fallen—'mid "tears of perfect moan."27

He was a goodly spirit—he who fell:
A wanderer by mossy-mantled well—
A gazer on the lights that shine above—
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair—
And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy
To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
The night had found (to him a night of wo)
Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo—
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
Here sate he with his love—his dark eye bent
With eagle gaze along the firmament:
Now turn'd it upon her—but ever then
It trembled to the orb of Earth again.

"Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray!
How lovely 'tis to look so far away!
She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
I left her gorgeous halls—nor mourned to leave,
That eve—that eve—I should remember well—
The sun-ray dropped, in Lemnos with a spell
On th' Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall—
And on my eyelids—O, the heavy light!
How drowsily it weighed them into night!
On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
But O, that light!—I slumbered—Death, the while,
Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle
So softly that no single silken hair
Awoke that slept—or knew that he was there.

"The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon
Was a proud temple called the Parthenon;28
More beauty clung around her columned wall
Then even thy glowing bosom beats withal,29
And when old Time my wing did disenthral
Thence sprang I—as the eagle from his tower,
And years I left behind me in an hour.
What time upon her airy bounds I hung,
One half the garden of her globe was flung
Unrolling as a chart unto my view—
Tenantless cities of the desert too!
Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
And half I wished to be again of men."

"My Angelo! and why of them to be?
A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee—
And greener fields than in yon world above,
And woman's loveliness—and passionate love."
"But list, Ianthe! when the air so soft
Failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft,30
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy—but the world
I left so late was into chaos hurled,
Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,
And rolled a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar,
And fell—not swiftly as I rose before,
But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'
Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
For nearest of all stars was thine to ours—
Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
A red Daedalion on the timid Earth."

"We came—and to thy Earth—but not to us
Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:
We came, my love; around, above, below,
Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
She grants to us as granted by her God—
But, Angelo, than thine gray Time unfurled
Never his fairy wing o'er fairer world!
Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea—
But when its glory swelled upon the sky,
As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,
We paused before the heritage of men,
And thy star trembled—as doth Beauty then!"

Thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away
The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.

The drift of Milton's argument leads him to employ language which would appear, at first sight, to verge upon their doctrine; but it will be seen immediately, that he guards himself against the charge of having adopted one of the most ignorant errors of the dark ages of the Church.—Dr. Sumner's Notes on Milton's Christian Doctrine.

This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary, could never have been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of Mesopotamia, was condemned for the opinion, as heretical. He lived in the beginning of the fourth century. His disciples were called Anthropomorphites.—Vide du Pin.

It is said (Tacitus, Strabo, Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau, Maundrell, Troilo, D'Arvieux), that after an excessive drought, the vestiges of columns, walls, etc., are seen above the surface.

Sorrow is not excluded from "Al Aaraaf," but it is that sorrow which the living love to cherish for the dead, and which, in some minds, resembles the delirium of opium.

The passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures—the price of which, to those souls who make choice of "Al Aaraaf" as their residence after life, is final death and annihilation.

Tamerlane

Kind solace in a dying hour!
Such, father, is not (now) my theme—
I will not madly deem that power
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
Unearthly pride hath revelled in—
I have no time to dote or dream:
You call it hope—that fire of fire!
It is but agony of desire:
If I can hope—O God! I can—
Its fount is holier—more divine—
I would not call thee fool, old man,
But such is not a gift of thine.

Know thou the secret of a spirit
Bowed from its wild pride into shame
O yearning heart! I did inherit
Thy withering portion with the fame,
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the Jewels of my throne,
Halo of Hell! and with a pain
Not Hell shall make me fear again—
O craving heart, for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours!
The undying voice of that dead time,
With its interminable chime,
Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
Upon thy emptiness—a knell.

I have not always been as now:
The fevered diadem on my brow
I claimed and won usurpingly—
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the Cæsar—this to me?
The heritage of a kingly mind,
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with human kind.
On mountain soil I first drew life:
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head,
And, I believe, the winged strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair.

So late from Heaven—that dew—it fell
('Mid dreams of an unholy night)
Upon me with the touch of Hell,
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,
Appeared to my half-closing eye
The pageantry of monarchy;
And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
Came hurriedly upon me, telling
Of human battle, where my voice,
My own voice, silly child!—was swelling
(O! how my spirit would rejoice,
And leap within me at the cry)
The battle-cry of Victory!

The rain came down upon my head
Unsheltered—and the heavy wind
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
It was but man, I thought, who shed
Laurels upon me: and the rush—
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires—with the captive's prayer—
The hum of suitors—and the tone
Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.

My passions, from that hapless hour,
Usurped a tyranny which men
Have deemed since I have reached to power,
My innate nature—be it so:
But, father, there lived one who, then,
Then—in my boyhood—when their fire
Burned with a still intenser glow
(For passion must, with youth, expire)
E'en then who knew this iron heart
In woman's weakness had a part.

I have no words—alas!—to tell
The loveliness of loving well!
Nor would I now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
Are—shadows on th' unstable wind:
Thus I remember having dwelt
Some page of early lore upon,
With loitering eye, till I have felt
The letters—with their meaning—melt
To fantasies—with none.

O, she was worthy of all love!
Love as in infancy was mine—
'Twas such as angel minds above
Might envy; her young heart the shrine
On which my every hope and thought
Were incense—then a goodly gift,
For they were childish and upright—
Pure—as her young example taught:
Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
Trust to the fire within, for light?

We grew in age—and love—together—
Roaming the forest, and the wild;
My breast her shield in wintry weather—
And, when the friendly sunshine smiled.
And she would mark the opening skies,
I saw no Heaven—but in her eyes.
Young Love's first lesson is——the heart:
For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
When, from our little cares apart,
And laughing at her girlish wiles,
I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,
And pour my spirit out in tears—
There was no need to speak the rest—
No need to quiet any fears
Of her—who asked no reason why,
But turned on me her quiet eye!

Yet more than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with, and strove
When, on the mountain peak, alone,
Ambition lent it a new tone—
I had no being—but in thee:
The world, and all it did contain
In the earth—the air—the sea—
Its joy—its little lot of pain
That was new pleasure—the ideal,
Dim, vanities of dreams by night—
And dimmer nothings which were real—
(Shadows—and a more shadowy light!)
Parted upon their misty wings,
And, so, confusedly, became
Thine image and—a name—a name!
Two separate—yet most intimate things.

I was ambitious—have you known
The passion, father? You have not:
A cottager, I marked a throne
Of half the world as all my own,
And murmured at such lowly lot—
But, just like any other dream,
Upon the vapor of the dew
My own had past, did not the beam
Of beauty which did while it thro'
The minute—the hour—the day—oppress
My mind with double loveliness.

We walked together on the crown
Of a high mountain which looked down
Afar from its proud natural towers
Of rock and forest, on the hills—
The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
And shouting with a thousand rills.

I spoke to her of power and pride,
But mystically—in such guise
That she might deem it nought beside
The moment's converse; in her eyes
I read, perhaps too carelessly—
A mingled feeling with my own—
The flush on her bright cheek, to me
Seemed to become a queenly throne
Too well that I should let it be
Light in the wilderness alone.

I wrapped myself in grandeur then,
And donned a visionary crown—
Yet it was not that Fantasy
Had thrown her mantle over me—
But that, among the rabble—men,
Lion ambition is chained down—
And crouches to a keeper's hand—
Not so in deserts where the grand—
The wild—the terrible conspire
With their own breath to fan his fire.

Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!—
Is she not queen of Earth? her pride
Above all cities? in her hand
Their destinies? in all beside
Of glory which the world hath known
Stands she not nobly and alone?
Falling—her veriest stepping-stone
Shall form the pedestal of a throne—
And who her sovereign? Timour—he
Whom the astonished people saw
Striding o'er empires haughtily
A diademed outlaw!

O, human love! thou spirit given,
On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
Which fall'st into the soul like rain
Upon the Siroc-withered plain,
And, failing in thy power to bless,
But leav'st the heart a wilderness!
Idea! which bindest life around
With music of so strange a sound
And beauty of so wild a birth—
Farewell! for I have won the Earth.

When Hope, the eagle that towered, could see
No cliff beyond him in the sky,
His pinions were bent droopingly—
And homeward turned his softened eye.
'Twas sunset: When the sun will part
There comes a sullenness of heart
To him who still would look upon
The glory of the summer sun.
That soul will hate the ev'ning mist
So often lovely, and will list
To the sound of the coming darkness (known
To those whose spirits hearken) as one
Who, in a dream of night, would fly,
But cannot, from a danger nigh.

What tho' the moon—tho' the white moon
Shed all the splendor of her noon,
Her smile is chilly—and her beam,
In that time of dreariness, will seem
(So like you gather in your breath)
A portrait taken after death.
And boyhood is a summer sun
Whose waning is the dreariest one—
For all we live to know is known,
And all we seek to keep hath flown—
Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
With the noon-day beauty—which is all.
I reached my home—my home no more—
For all had flown who made it so.
I passed from out its mossy door,
And, tho' my tread was soft and low,
A voice came from the threshold stone
Of one whom I had earlier known—
O, I defy thee, Hell, to show
On beds of fire that burn below,
An humbler heart—a deeper woe.

Father, I firmly do believe—
I know—for Death who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar,
Where there is nothing to deceive,
Hath left his iron gate ajar.
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing thro' Eternity——
I do believe that Eblis hath
A snare in every human path—
Else how, when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol, Love,—
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt-offerings
From the most unpolluted things,
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trellised rays from Heaven
No mote may shun—no tiniest fly—
The light'ning of his eagle eye—
How was it that Ambition crept,
Unseen, amid the revels there,
Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
In the tangles of Love's very hair!

To Helen

Helen, thy beauty is to me
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore.

On desperate seas long wont to roam,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was Greece,
To the grandeur that was Rome.

Lo! in yon brilliant window niche,
How statue-like I see thee stand,
The agate lamp within thy hand!
Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
Are Holy Land!

The Valley of Unrest

Once it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell;
They had gone unto the wars,
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
Nightly, from their azure towers,
To keep watch above the flowers,
In the midst of which all day
The red sun-light lazily lay,
Now each visitor shall confess
The sad valley's restlessness.
Nothing there is motionless—
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude.
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides!
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Unceasingly, from morn till even,
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye—
Over the lilies that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave:—from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep:—from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.

Israfel1

In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
"Whose heart-strings are a lute;"
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
Of his voice, all mute.

Tottering above
In her highest noon,
The enamoured Moon
Blushes with love,
While, to listen, the red levin
(With the rapid Pleiads, even,
Which were seven),
Pauses in Heaven.

And they say (the starry choir
And the other listening things)
That Israfeli's fire
Is owing to that lyre
By which he sits and sings—
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings.

But the skies that angel trod,
Where deep thoughts are a duty—
Where Love's a grow-up God—
Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star.

Therefore, thou art not wrong,
Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live and long!

The ecstasies above
With thy burning measures suit—
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
With the fervor of thy lute—
Well may the stars be mute!

Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
Is a world of sweets and sours;
Our flowers are merely—flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours.

If I could dwell
Where Israfel
Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky.

To the River

Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
Of crystal, wandering water,
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beauty—the unhidden heart—
The playful maziness of art
In old Alberto's daughter;

But when within thy wave she looks—
Which glistens then, and trembles—
Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles;
For in his heart, as in thy stream,
Her image deeply lies—
His heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soul-searching eyes.

Song

I saw thee on thy bridal day—
When a burning blush came o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee:

And in thine eye a kindling light
(Whatever it might be)
Was all on Earth my aching sight
Of Loveliness could see.

That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame—
As such it well may pass—
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
In the breast of him, alas!

Who saw thee on that bridal day,
When that deep blush would come o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee.

Spirits of the Dead

Thy soul shall find itself alone
'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy.
Be silent in that solitude
Which is not loneliness—for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee—and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.
The night—tho' clear—shall frown—
And the stars shall not look down
From their high thrones in the Heaven,
With light like Hope to mortals given—
But their red orbs, without beam,
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee forever.
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish—
Now are visions ne'er to vanish—
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more—like dew-drops from the grass.
The breeze—the breath of God—is still—
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy—shadowy—yet unbroken,
Is a symbol and a token—
How it hangs upon the trees,
A mystery of mysteries!

In visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed—
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.
Ah! what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?
That holy dream—that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
A lonely spirit guiding.
What though that light, thro' storm and night,
So trembled from afar—
What could there be more purely bright
In Truth's day star?

Romance

Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
With drowsy head and folded wing,
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake,
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been—a most familiar bird—
Taught me my alphabet to say—
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie,
A child—with a most knowing eye.

Of late, eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by,
I have no time for idle cares
Though gazing on the unquiet sky.
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings—
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away—forbidden things!
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings.

Fairyland

Dim vales—and shadowy floods—
And cloudy-looking woods,
Whose forms we can't discover
For the tears that drip all over
Huge moons there wax and wane—
Again—again—again—
Every moment of the night—
Forever changing places—
And they put out the star-light
With the breath from their pale faces.
About twelve by the moon-dial
One more filmy than the rest
(A kind which, upon trial,
They have found to be the best)
Comes down—still down—and down
With its centre on the crown
Of a mountain's eminence,
While its wide circumference
In easy drapery falls
Over hamlets, over halls,
Wherever they may be—
O'er the strange woods—o'er the sea—
Over spirits on the wing—
Over every drowsy thing—
And buries them up quite
In a labyrinth of light—
And then, how deep!—O, deep!
Is the passion of their sleep.
In the morning they arise,
And their moony covering
Is soaring in the skies,
With the tempests as they toss,
Like—almost any thing—
Or a yellow Albatross.
They use that moon no more
For the same end as before—
Videlicet a tent—
Which I think extravagant:
Its atomies, however,
Into a shower dissever,
Of which those butterflies,
Of Earth, who seek the skies,
And so come down again
(Never-contented thing!)
Have brought a specimen
Upon their quivering wings.

The Lake

In spring of youth it was my lot
To haunt of the wide world a spot
The which I could not love the less—
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
And the tall pines that towered around.

But when the Night had thrown her pall
Upon the spot, as upon all,
And the mystic wind went by
Murmuring in melody—
Then—ah, then, I would awake
To the terror of the lone lake.

Yet that terror was not fright,
But a tremulous delight—
A feeling not the jewelled mine
Could teach or bribe me to define—
Nor Love—although the Love were thine.

Death was in that poisonous wave,
And in its gulf a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his lone imagining—
Whose solitary soul could make
An Eden of that dim lake.

Evening Star

'Twas noontide of summer,
And midtime of night,
And stars, in their orbits,
Shone pale, through the light
Of the brighter, cold moon.
'Mid planets her slaves,
Herself in the Heavens,
Her beam on the waves.

I gazed awhile
On her cold smile;
Too cold—too cold for me—
There passed, as a shroud,
A fleecy cloud,
And I turned away to thee,
Proud Evening Star,
In thy glory afar
And dearer thy beam shall be;
For joy to my heart
Is the proud part
Thou bearest in Heaven at night,
And more I admire
Thy distant fire,
Than that colder, lowly light.

Imitation

A dark unfathomed tide
Of interminable pride—
A mystery, and a dream,
Should my early life seem;
I say that dream was fraught
With a wild and waking thought
Of beings that have been,
Which my spirit hath not seen,
Had I let them pass me by,
With a dreaming eye!
Let none of earth inherit
That vision on my spirit;
Those thoughts I would control,
As a spell upon his soul:
For that bright hope at last
And that light time have past,
And my wordly rest hath gone
With a sigh as it passed on:
I care not though it perish
With a thought I then did cherish.

Hymn (translation from the Greek

Hymn to Aristogeiton and Harmodius

I	Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal,
Like those champions devoted and brave,
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
And to Athens deliverance gave.
II	Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam
In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
Where the mighty of old have their home—
Where Achilles and Diomed rest.
III	In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,
Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,
When he made at the tutelar shrine
A libation of Tyranny's blood.
IV	Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!
Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!
Endless ages shall cherish your fame,
Embalmed in their echoing songs!

Dreams

Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
My spirit not awakening, till the beam
Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.
Yes! though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
'Twere better than the cold reality
Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
But should it be—that dream eternally
Continuing—as dreams have been to me
In my young boyhood—should it thus be given,
'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.
For I have revelled when the sun was bright
I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light
And loveliness,—have left my very heart
Inclines of my imaginary apart1
From mine own home, with beings that have been
Of mine own thought—what more could I have seen?
'Twas once—and only once—and the wild hour
From my remembrance shall not pass—some power
Or spell had bound me—'twas the chilly wind
Came o'er me in the night, and left behind
Its image on my spirit—or the moon
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly—or the stars—howe'er it was
That dream was that that night-wind—let it pass.
I have been happy, though in a dream.
I have been happy—and I love the theme:
Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
Of semblance with reality which brings
To the delirious eye, more lovely things
Of Paradise and Love—and all my own!—
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.

"In Youth I have Known One"

How often we forget all time, when lone
Admiring Nature's universal throne;
Her woods—her wilds—her mountains—the intense
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!
I	In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
In secret communing held—as he with it,
In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:
Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
A passionate light such for his spirit was fit—
And yet that spirit knew—not in the hour
Of its own fervor—what had o'er it power.
II	Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
To a ferver1 by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,
But I will half believe that wild light fraught
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
Hath ever told—or is it of a thought
The unembodied essence, and no more
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
As dew of the night-time, o'er the summer grass?
III	Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye
To the loved object—so the tear to the lid
Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
And yet it need not be—(that object) hid
From us in life—but common—which doth lie
Each hour before us—but then only bid
With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken
T' awake us—'Tis a symbol and a token—
IV	Of what in other worlds shall be—and given
In beauty by our God, to those alone
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
Though not with Faith—with godliness—whose throne
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.

A Pæan

I	How shall the burial rite be read?
The solemn song be sung?
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
That ever died so young?
II	Her friends are gazing on her,
And on her gaudy bier,
And weep!—oh! to dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear!
III	They loved her for her wealth—
And they hated her for her pride—
But she grew in feeble health,
And they love her—that she died.
IV	They tell me (while they speak
Of her "costly broider'd pall")
That my voice is growing weak—
That I should not sing at all—
V	Or that my tone should be
Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully—so mournfully,
That the dead may feel no wrong.
VI	But she is gone above,
With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
Of the dead, who is my bride.—
VII	Of the dead—dead who lies
All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes.
And the life upon her hair.
VIII	Thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike—the murmur sent
Through the gray chambers to my song,
Shall be the accompaniment.
IX	Thou diedst in thy life's June—
But thou didst not die too fair:
Thou didst not die too soon,
Nor with too calm an air.
X	From more than friends on earth,
Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven.—
XI	Therefore, to thee this night
I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
With a Pæan of old days.

Notes

On the "Poems written in Youth" little comment is needed. This section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 (which was subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.
Note on Al Aaraaf

"Al Aaraaf" first appeared, with the sonnet "To Silence" prefixed to it, in 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however, this poem, its author's longest, was introduced by the following twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent collections:
Mysterious star!
Thou wert my dream
All a long summer night—
Be now my theme!
By this clear stream,
Of thee will I write;
Meantime from afar
Bathe me in light!

Thy world has not the dross of ours,
Yet all the beauty—all the flowers
That list our love or deck our bowers
In dreamy gardens, where do lie
Dreamy maidens all the day;
While the silver winds of Circassy
On violet couches faint away.
Little—oh! little dwells in thee
Like unto what on earth we see:
Beauty's eye is here the bluest
In the falsest and untruest—
On the sweetest air doth float
The most sad and solemn note—
If with thee be broken hearts,
Joy so peacefully departs,
That its echo still doth dwell,
Like the murmur in the shell.
Thou! thy truest type of grief
Is the gently falling leaf—
Thou! thy framing is so holy
Sorrow is not melancholy.

Note on Tamerlane

The earliest version of "Tamerlane" was included in the suppressed volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at least.
Contents p. 2


Note on To Helen, The Valley of Unrest, Israfel etc.

"To Helen" first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also "The Valley of Unrest" (as "The Valley Nis"), "Israfel," and one or two others of the youthful pieces.
Contents p. 2


Note on Romance

The poem styled "Romance" constituted the Preface of the 1829 volume, but with the addition of the following lines:
Succeeding years, too wild for song,
Then rolled like tropic storms along,
Where, though the garish lights that fly
Dying along the troubled sky,
Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,
The blackness of the general Heaven,
That very blackness yet doth fling
Light on the lightning's silver wing.

For being an idle boy lang syne,
Who read Anacreon and drank wine,
I early found Anacreon rhymes
Were almost passionate sometimes—
And by strange alchemy of brain
His pleasures always turned to pain—
His naïveté to wild desire—
His wit to love—his wine to fire—
And so, being young and dipt in folly,
I fell in love with melancholy.

And used to throw my earthly rest
And quiet all away in jest—
I could not love except where Death
Was mingling his with Beauty's breath—
Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,
Were stalking between her and me.

...

But now my soul hath too much room—
Gone are the glory and the gloom—
The black hath mellow'd into gray,
And all the fires are fading away.

My draught of passion hath been deep—
I revell'd, and I now would sleep—
And after drunkenness of soul
Succeeds the glories of the bowl—
An idle longing night and day
To dream my very life away.

But dreams—of those who dream as I,
Aspiringly, are damned, and die:
Yet should I swear I mean alone,
By notes so very shrilly blown,
To break upon Time's monotone,
While yet my vapid joy and grief
Are tintless of the yellow leaf—
Why not an imp the greybeard hath,
Will shake his shadow in my path—
And e'en the greybeard will o'erlook
Connivingly my dreaming-book.

Doubtful Poems

Alone

From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were—I have not seen
As others saw—I could not bring
My passions from a common spring—
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow—I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone—
And all I loved—I loved alone—
Thou—in my childhood—in the dawn
Of a most stormy life—was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still—
From the torrent, or the fountain—
From the red cliff of the mountain—
From the sun that round me roll'd
In its autumn tint of gold—
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by—
From the thunder and the storm—
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view.

To Isadore

I	Beneath the vine-clad eaves,
Whose shadows fall before
Thy lowly cottage door—
Under the lilac's tremulous leaves—
Within thy snowy clasped hand
The purple flowers it bore.
Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,
Like queenly nymph from Fairy-land—
Enchantress of the flowery wand,
Most beauteous Isadore!
II	And when I bade the dream
Upon thy spirit flee,
Thy violet eyes to me
Upturned, did overflowing seem
With the deep, untold delight
Of Love's serenity;
Thy classic brow, like lilies white
And pale as the Imperial Night
Upon her throne, with stars bedight,
Enthralled my soul to thee!
III	Ah! ever I behold
Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
Blue as the languid skies
Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold;
Now strangely clear thine image grows,
And olden memories
Are startled from their long repose
Like shadows on the silent snows
When suddenly the night-wind blows
Where quiet moonlight lies.
IV	Like music heard in dreams,
Like strains of harps unknown,
Of birds for ever flown,—
Audible as the voice of streams
That murmur in some leafy dell,
I hear thy gentlest tone,
And Silence cometh with her spell
Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
When tremulous in dreams I tell
My love to thee alone!
V	In every valley heard,
Floating from tree to tree,
Less beautiful to me,
The music of the radiant bird,
Than artless accents such as thine
Whose echoes never flee!
Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:—
For uttered in thy tones benign
(Enchantress!) this rude name of mine
Doth seem a melody!

The Village Street

In these rapid, restless shadows,
Once I walked at eventide,
When a gentle, silent maiden,
Walked in beauty at my side.
She alone there walked beside me
All in beauty, like a bride.

Pallidly the moon was shining
On the dewy meadows nigh;
On the silvery, silent rivers,
On the mountains far and high,—
On the ocean's star-lit waters,
Where the winds a-weary die.

Slowly, silently we wandered
From the open cottage door,
Underneath the elm's long branches
To the pavement bending o'er;
Underneath the mossy willow
And the dying sycamore.

With the myriad stars in beauty
All bedight, the heavens were seen,
Radiant hopes were bright around me,
Like the light of stars serene;
Like the mellow midnight splendor
Of the Night's irradiate queen.

Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
Like the distant murmured music
Of unquiet, lovely seas;
While the winds were hushed in slumber
In the fragrant flowers and trees.

Wondrous and unwonted beauty
Still adorning all did seem,
While I told my love in fables
'Neath the willows by the stream;
Would the heart have kept unspoken
Love that was its rarest dream!

Instantly away we wandered
In the shadowy twilight tide,
She, the silent, scornful maiden,
Walking calmly at my side,
With a step serene and stately,
All in beauty, all in pride.

Vacantly I walked beside her.
On the earth mine eyes were cast;
Swift and keen there came unto me
Bitter memories of the past—
On me, like the rain in Autumn
On the dead leaves, cold and fast.

Underneath the elms we parted,
By the lowly cottage door;
One brief word alone was uttered—
Never on our lips before;
And away I walked forlornly,
Broken-hearted evermore.

Slowly, silently I loitered,
Homeward, in the night, alone;
Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
That my youth had never known;
Wild unrest, like that which cometh
When the Night's first dream hath flown.

Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
Mad, discordant melodies,
And keen melodies like shadows
Haunt the moaning willow trees,
And the sycamores with laughter
Mock me in the nightly breeze.

Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
Through the sighing foliage streams;
And each morning, midnight shadow,
Shadow of my sorrow seems;
Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!
And, O soul, forget thy dreams!

The Forest Reverie

'Tis said that when
The hands of men
Tamed this primeval wood,
And hoary trees with groans of wo,
Like warriors by an unknown foe,
Were in their strength subdued,
The virgin Earth
Gave instant birth
To springs that ne'er did flow—
That in the sun
Did rivulets run,
And all around rare flowers did blow—
The wild rose pale
Perfumed the gale,
And the queenly lily adown the dale
(Whom the sun and the dew
And the winds did woo),
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.

So when in tears
The love of years
Is wasted like the snow,
And the fine fibrils of its life
By the rude wrong of instant strife
Are broken at a blow—
Within the heart
Do springs upstart
Of which it doth now know,
And strange, sweet dreams,
Like silent streams
That from new fountains overflow,
With the earlier tide
Of rivers glide
Deep in the heart whose hope has died—
Quenching the fires its ashes hide,—
Its ashes, whence will spring and grow
Sweet flowers, ere long,—
The rare and radiant flowers of song!

Notes

Note on Alone

Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe, and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled "Alone" have the chief claim to our notice. Fac-simile copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in Scribner's Magazine for September 1875; but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from publishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been adduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us. "Alone" is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the fac-simile given in Scribner's is alleged to be of his handwriting. If the calligraphy be Poe's, it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added. The lines, however, if not by Poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, "are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them."

Note on To Isadore etc.

Whilst Edgar Poe was editor of the Broadway Journal, some lines "To Isadore" appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying they were by "A. Ide, junior." Two previous poems had appeared in the Broadway Journal over the signature of "A. M. Ide," and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines "To Isadore." In order, doubtless, to give a show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over noms de plume, and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of "A. M. Ide," it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of "The Raven." Having been published without his usual elaborate revision, Poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection, so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of "The Raven."

Prose Poems

The Island of the Fay

"Nullus enim locus sine genio est."

Servius.
"La musique," says Marmontel, in those "Contes Moraux"1 which in all our translations we have insisted upon calling "Moral Tales," as if in mockery of their spirit—"la musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse de lui-meme: tous les autres veulent des temoins." He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is doubtless the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition in this form will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me at least the presence, not of human life only, but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at war with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,—I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole—a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity; whose thought is that of a god; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculæ which infest the brain, a being which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the same manner as these animalculæ must thus regard us.

Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood, that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of matter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle—indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the operations of Deity, it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the Godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring through self-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast "clod of the valley" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul, for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation2.

These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman3 was it who said, in allusion to the well known work of Zimmermann, that "la solitude est une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose"? The epigram cannot be gainsaid; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.

It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns writhing or sleeping within all, that I chanced upon a certain rivulet and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore.

On all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east; while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.

About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.
So blended bank and shadow there,
That each seemed pendulous in air—
so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began. My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet, and I observed a singularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eye of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out the heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings4.

The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things. The trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude—wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed.

This idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and I lost myself forthwith in reverie. "If ever island were enchanted," said I to myself, "this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?—or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God little by little their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?"

As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the sycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased; while I thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom I had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. "The revolution which has just been made by the Fay," continued I musingly, "is the cycle of the brief year of her life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a year nearer unto death: for I did not fail to see that as she came into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the dark water, making its blackness more black."

And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy. She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened momently), and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the circuit of the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length, when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all things, and I beheld her magical figure no more.

The Power of Words

Oinos.	Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with immortality!
Agathos.	You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded. Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition. For wisdom, ask of the angels freely, that it may be given!
Oinos.	But in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.
Agathos.	Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of knowledge! In forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know all, were the curse of a fiend.
Oinos.	But does not The Most High know all?
Agathos.	That (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the one thing unknown even to Him.
Oinos.	But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things be known?
Agathos.	Look down into the abysmal distances! —attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them thus—and thus—and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?—the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?
Oinos.	I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.
Agathos.	There are no dreams in Aidenn—but it is here whispered that, of this infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever unquenchable within it—since to quench it would be to extinguish the soul's self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear. Come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for pansies and violets, and heart's-ease, are the beds of the triplicate and triple-tinted suns.
Oinos.	And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!—speak to me in the earth's familiar tones! I understand not what you hinted to me just now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is not God?
Agathos.	I mean to say that the Deity does not create.
Oinos.	Explain
Agathos.	In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which are now throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or immediate results of the Divine creative power.
Oinos.	Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the extreme.
Agathos.	Among the angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.
Oinos.	I can comprehend you thus far—that certain operations of what we term Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise to that which has all the appearance of creation. Shortly before the final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of animalculæ.
Agathos.	The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary creation, and of the only species of creation which has ever been since the first word spoke into existence the first law.
Oinos.	Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens—are not these stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the King?
Agathos.	Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth's air, which thenceforward, and forever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew. They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation—so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty; from a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless—and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis—who saw, too, the facility of the retrogradation—these men saw, at the same time, that this species of analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress—that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.
Oinos.	And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?
Agathos.	Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite understanding—one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfolded—there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air—and the ether through the air—to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must in the end impress every individual thing that exists within the universe;— and the being of infinite understanding—the being whom we have imagined—might trace the remote undulations of the impulse—trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of all matter—upward and onward forever in their modifications of old forms—or, in other words, in their creation of new—until he found them reflected—unimpressive at last—back from the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this, but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him—should one of these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection—he could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection—this faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes—is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone—but in every variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic Intelligences.
Oinos.	But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.
Agathos.	In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth: but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether—which, since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of creation.
Oinos.	Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?
Agathos.	It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all motion is thought —and the source of all thought is—
Oinos.	God.
Agathos.	I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child, of the fair Earth which lately perished—of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.
Oinos.	You did.
Agathos.	And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words? Is not every word an impulse on the air?
Oinos.	But why, Agathos, do you weep—and why, oh, why do your wings droop as we hover above this fair star—which is the greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream —but its fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart.
Agathos.	They are!—they are!—This wild star —it is now three centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my beloved —I spoke it—with a few passionate sentences—into birth. Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts!

The Colloquy of Monos and Una

Greek: Mellonta sauta'

These things are in the future.

Sophocles—Antig.


Una.	"Born again?"
Monos.	Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, "born again." These were the words upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the explanations of the priesthood, until Death itself resolved for me the secret.
Una.	Death!
Monos.	How strangely, sweet Una, you echo my words! I observe, too, a vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal. Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew upon all pleasures!
Una.	Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How often, Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! How mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, "thus far, and no farther!" That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its strength! Alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus in time it became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy then.
Monos.	Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una —mine, mine forever now!
Una.	But the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? I have much to say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow.
Monos.	And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in vain? I will be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative begin?
Una.	At what point?
Monos.	You have said.
Una.	Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the propensity of man to define the indefinable. I will not say, then, commence with the moment of life's cessation—but commence with that sad, sad instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.
Monos.	One word first, my Una, in regard to man's general condition at this epoch. You will remember that one or two of the wise among our forefathers—wise in fact, although not in the world's esteem—had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term "improvement," as applied to the progress of our civilization. There were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious —principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control. At long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility. Occasionally the poetic intellect—that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all—since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to the unaided reason bears no weight—occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of his soul. And these men —the poets—living and perishing amid the scorn of the "utilitarians"—of rough pedants, who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the scorned—these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen—days when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was happiness—holy, august, and blissful days, blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored. Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil days. The great "movement" —that was the cant term—went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art—the Arts— arose supreme, and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion over her elements. Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. As might be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities. Among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and in the face of analogy and of God—in despite of the loud warning voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in Earth and Heaven—wild attempts at an omniprevalent Democracy were made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil, Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have arrested us here. But now it appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this crisis that taste alone—that faculty which, holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely have been disregarded—it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas for the Greek: mousichae which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!—since both were most desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised1. Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how truly!—"Que tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au sentiment;" and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But this thing was not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old age of the world drew near. This the mass of mankind saw not, or, living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. But, for myself, the Earth's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our Fate from comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria the architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than either, the turbulent mother of all Arts. In the history of these regions I met with a ray from the Future. The individual artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the Earth, and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied; but for the infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration save in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw that he must be "born again."

And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits, daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at length a fit dwelling-place for man:—for man the Death-purged—for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more —for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal, but still for the material, man.
Una.	Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. Men lived; and died individually. You yourself sickened, and passed into the grave; and thither your constant Una speedily followed you. And though the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration, yet my Monos, it was a century still.
Monos.	Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. Unquestionably, it was in the Earth's dotage that I died. Wearied at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the fierce fever. After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you—after some days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless torpor; and this was termed Death by those who stood around me.

Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of sentience. It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without being awakened by external disturbances.

I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased to beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were unusually active, although eccentrically so—assuming often each other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers—fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. The eye-lids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance, the balls could not roll in their sockets—but all objects within the range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as sound— sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade —curved or angular in outline. The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in action—estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had undergone a modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length, long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. All my perceptions were purely sensual. The materials furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding. Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while large and constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone. And this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke reverently, in low whispers—you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud cries.

They attired me for the coffin—three or four dark figures which flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my vision they affected me as forms; but upon passing to my side their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe. You alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about.

The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a vague uneasiness—an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear—low distant bell-tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp (for there were many), there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to sentiment itself— a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before.

And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its exercise I found a wild delight—yet a delight still physical, inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the animal frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct conception. Let me term it a mental pendulous pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of Time. By the absolute equalization of this movement—or of such as this—had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted. By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel, and of the watches of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously to my ears. The slightest deviations from the true proportion—and these deviations were omniprevalent—affected me just as violations of abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense. Although no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. And this—this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of duration—this sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist) independently of any succession of events—this idea —this sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the temporal eternity.

It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had departed from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the monotonous strains. But suddenly these strains diminished in distinctness and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in my nostrils died away. Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shot like that of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact. All of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly Decay.

Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you sat by my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side, which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.

And here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its flight—without effort and without object.

A year passed. The consciousness of being had grown hourly more indistinct, and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of place. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body was now growing to be the body itself. At length, as often happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is Death imaged) —at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking, yet left him half enveloped in dreams—so to me, in the strict embrace of the Shadow, came that light which alone might have had power to startle—the light of enduring Love. Men toiled at the grave in which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp earth. Upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of Una. And now again all was void. That nebulous light had been extinguished. That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into quiescence. Many lustra had supervened. Dust had returned to dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead— instead of all things, dominant and perpetual—the autocrats Place and Time. For that which was not—for that which had no form—for that which had no thought—for that which had no sentience—for that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no portion—for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.





Footnote 1:  
"It will be hard to discover a better [method of education] than that which the experience of so many ages has already discovered; and this may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body, and music for the soul."
Repub. lib. 2.
"For this reason is a musical education most essential; since it causes Rhythm and Harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul, taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it with beauty and making the man beautiful-minded. ... He will praise and admire the beautiful, will receive it with joy into his soul, will feed upon it, and assimilate his own condition with it."
Ibid. lib. 3. Music had, however, among the Athenians, a far more comprehensive signification than with us. It included not only the harmonies of time and of tune, but the poetic diction, sentiment and creation, each in its widest sense. The study of music was with them, in fact, the general cultivation of the taste—of that which recognizes the beautiful—in contradistinction from reason, which deals only with the true.

The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion

I will bring fire to thee.

Euripides.—Androm.


Eiros.	Why do you call me Eiros?
Charmion.	So henceforward will you always be called. You must forget, too, my earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.
Eiros.	This is indeed no dream!
Charmion.	Dreams are with us no more;—but of these mysteries anon. I rejoice to see you looking life-like and rational. The film of the shadow has already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart, and fear nothing. Your allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow I will myself induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence.
Eiros.	True—I feel no stupor—none at all. The wild sickness and the terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad, rushing, horrible sound, like the "voice of many waters." Yet my senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception of the new.
Charmion.	A few days will remove all this;— but I fully understand you, and feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you undergo—yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have now suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in Aidenn.
Eiros.	In Aidenn?
Charmion.	In Aidenn.
Eiros.	O God!—pity me, Charmion!—I am overburthened with the majesty of all things—of the unknown now known—of the speculative Future merged in the august and certain Present.
Charmion.	Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of this. Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward—but back. I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so fearfully perished.
Eiros.	Most fearfully, fearfully!—this is indeed no dream.
Charmion.	Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?
Eiros.	Mourned, Charmion?—oh, deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.
Charmion.	And that last hour—speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave—at that period, if I remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day.
Eiros.	The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as having reference to the orb of the earth alone, But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had been well established. They had been observed to pass among the satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were accurately known. That among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.

The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There were two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of very unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color. Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations. The learned now gave their intellect—their soul—to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought—they panted for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored.

That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated that the density of the comet's nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold. It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars—errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet—were now altogether unknown, as if by some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest.

What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. While such discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind grew paler as it came. All human operations were suspended.

There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms. A very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. Its historical attributes had disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion. We saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains. It had taken, with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.

Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every vegetable thing.

Yet another day—and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general lamentation and horror. The first sense of pain lay in a rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.

It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate;— the entire fulfilment, in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.

Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate. Meantime a day again passed—bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all men; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us;—even here in Aidenn I shudder while I speak. Let me be brief—brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then—let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God!—then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of Him; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.

Shadow — a Parable

Yea! though I walk through the valley of the Shadow.

Psalm of David.


Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows. For indeed strange things shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will be some to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.

The year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is enjoined with the red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of mankind.

Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of seven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise in the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless streets—but the boding and the memory of Evil, they would not be so excluded. There were things around us and about of which I can render no distinct account— things material and spiritual—heaviness in the atmosphere— a sense of suffocation—anxiety—and, above all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our limbs—upon the household furniture—upon the goblets from which we drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby—all things save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel. Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way—which was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon—which are madness; and drank deeply—although the purple wine reminded us of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young Zoilus. Dead and at full length he lay, enshrouded;—the genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague, and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of Teos. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among those sable draperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and undefiled shadow—a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass. But the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor God—neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldæa, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus enshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation. And the shadow answered, "I am Shadow, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian canal." And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast: for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends.

Silence — a Fable

The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags, and caves are silent.

"Listen to me," said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head. "The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of the river Zäire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.

"The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow not onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many miles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto the other.

"But there is a boundary to their realm—the boundary of the dark, horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots, strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zäire there is neither quiet nor silence.

"It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies, and the rain fell upon my head—and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.

"And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon. And the rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,—and the rock was gray. Upon its front were characters engraven in the stones; and I walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decipher them. And I was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the characters;—and the characters were Desolation.

"And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the action of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the outlines of his figure were indistinct—but his features were the features of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and in the few furrows upon his cheek, I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.

"And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.

"And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the dreary river Zäire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.

"Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.

"Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind. And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest—and the rain beat upon the head of the man—and the floods of the river came down—and the river was tormented into foam—and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds—and the forest crumbled before the wind—and the thunder rolled —and the lightning fell—and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.

"Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed, and were still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven—and the thunder died away —and the lightning did not flash—and the clouds hung motionless—and the waters sunk to their level and remained—and the trees ceased to rock—and the water-lilies sighed no more—and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the rock, and they were changed;—and the characters were Silence.

"And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock were Silence. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more."

...

Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in the iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty Sea—and of the Genii that overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils; and holy, holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around Dodona—but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.

Essays

The Poetic Principle

In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either thorough or profound. While discussing very much at random the essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poems which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most definite impression. By "minor poems" I mean, of course, poems of little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, "a long poem," is simply a flat contradiction in terms.

I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it flags—fails—a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is, in effect, and in fact, no longer such.

There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum that the "Paradise Lost" is to be devoutly admired throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity—its totality of effect or impression—we read it (as would be necessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the work, we read it again; omitting the first book—that is to say, commencing with the second—we shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemned—that damnable which we had previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate, aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a nullity—and this is precisely the fact.

In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of Art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem were popular in reality—which I doubt—it is at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again.

That the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus, the measure of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition sufficiently absurd—yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere size, abstractly considered—there can be nothing in mere bulk, so far as a volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys, does impress us with a sense of the sublime—but no man is impressed after this fashion by the material grandeur of even "The Columbiad." Even the Quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As yet, they have not insisted on our estimating Lamartine by the cubic foot, or Pollock by the pound—but what else are we to infer from their continual prating about "sustained effort"? If, by "sustained effort," any little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the effort—if this indeed be a thing commendable— but let us forbear praising the epic on the effort's account. It is to be hoped thai common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art rather by the impression it makes— by the effect it produces—than by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of "sustained effort" which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another—nor can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.

On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax. De Béranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.

A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following exquisite little Serenade:
I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night
When the winds are breathing low,
And the stars are shining bright.
I arise from dreams of thee,
And a spirit in my feet
Has led me—who knows how?—
To thy chamber-window, sweet!

The wandering airs they faint
On the dark the silent stream—
The champak odors fail
Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
The nightingale's complaint,
It dies upon her heart,
As I must die on thine,
O, beloved as thou art!

O, lift me from the grass!
I die, I faint, I fail!
Let thy love in kisses rain
On my lips and eyelids pale.
My cheek is cold and white, alas!
My heart beats loud and fast:
O, press it close to thine again,
Where it will break at last!
Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.

One of the finest poems by Willis, the very best in my opinion which he has ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the critical than in the popular view:
The shadows lay along Broadway,
'Twas near the twilight-tide—
And slowly there a lady fair
Was walking in her pride.
Alone walk'd she; but, viewlessly
Walk'd spirits at her side.

Peace charm'd the street beneath her feet,
And honor charm'd the air;
And all astir looked kind on her,
And called her good as fair—
For all God ever gave to her
She kept with chary care.

She kept with care her beauties rare
From lovers warm and true—
For heart was cold to all but gold,
And the rich came not to woo—
But honor'd well her charms to sell,
If priests the selling do.

Now walking there was one more fair—
A slight girl, lily-pale;
And she had unseen company
To make the spirit quail—
Twixt Want and Scorn she walk'd forlorn,
And nothing could avail.

No mercy now can clear her brow
From this world's peace to pray,
For as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,
Her woman's heart gave way!—
But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven,
By man is cursed alway!
In this composition we find it difficult to recognise the Willis who has written so many mere "verses of society." The lines are not only richly ideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author.

While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of The Didactic. It has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate object of all Poetry is truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force:—but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem's sake.

With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All that which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all that with which she has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the poetical. He must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.

Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I place Taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with displaying the charms, waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of her deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to Beauty.

An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he exists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of delight. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind—he, I say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of man. It is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever, those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem, or through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.

The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness—this struggle, on the part of souls fittingly constituted—has given to the world all that which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and to feel as poetic.

The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes—in Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance—very especially in Music—and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected—is so vitally important an adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the poetic Sentiment, it struggles—the creation of supernal Beauty. It may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then, attained in fact. We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers had advantages which we do not possess—and Thomas Moore, singing his own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.

To recapitulate then:—I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with Truth.

A few words, however, in explanation. That pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation, or excitement of the soul, which we recognize as the Poetic Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of the heart. I make Beauty, therefore—using the word as inclusive of the sublime—I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causes:—no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the incitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem.

I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your consideration, than by the citation of the Pröem to Longfellow's "Waif":
The day is done, and the darkness
Falls from the wings of Night,
As a feather is wafted downward
From an eagle in his flight.

I see the lights of the village
Gleam through the rain and the mist,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,
That my soul cannot resist;

A feeling of sadness and longing,
That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain.

Come, read to me some poem,
Some simple and heartfelt lay,
That shall soothe this restless feeling,
And banish the thoughts of day.

Not from the grand old masters,
Not from the bards sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
Through the corridors of Time.

For, like strains of martial music,
Their mighty thoughts suggest
Life's endless toil and endeavor;
And to-night I long for rest.

Read from some humbler poet,
Whose songs gushed from his heart,
As showers from the clouds of summer,
Or tears from the eyelids start;

Who through long days of labor,
And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies.

Such songs have power to quiet
The restless pulse of care,
And come like the benediction
That follows after prayer.

Then read from the treasured volume
The poem of thy choice,
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
The beauty of thy voice.

And the night shall be filled with music,
And the cares that infest the day,
Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
And as silently steal away.
With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective. Nothing can be better than
—the bards sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
Down the corridors of Time.
The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments, and especially for the ease of the general manner. This "ease" or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone—as a point of really difficult attainment. But not so:—a natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with it—to the unnatural. It is but the result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that the tone, in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt—and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. The author who, after the fashion of The North American Review, should be upon all occasions merely "quiet," must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be considered "easy" or "natural" than a Cockney exquisite, or than the sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.

Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles "June." I quote only a portion of it:
There, through the long, long summer hours,
The golden light should lie,
And thick young herbs and groups of flowers
Stand in their beauty by.
The oriole should build and tell
His love-tale, close beside my cell;
The idle butterfly
Should rest him there, and there be heard
The housewife-bee and humming bird.

And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
Come, from the village sent,
Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
With fairy laughter blent?
And what if, in the evening light,
Betrothed lovers walk in sight
Of my low monument?
I would the lovely scene around
Might know no sadder sight nor sound.

I know, I know I should not see
The season's glorious show,
Nor would its brightness shine for me;
Nor its wild music flow;

But if, around my place of sleep,
The friends I love should come to weep,
They might not haste to go.
Soft airs and song, and light and bloom,
Should keep them lingering by my tomb.

These to their soften'd hearts should bear
The thought of what has been,
And speak of one who cannot share
The gladness of the scene;
Whose part in all the pomp that fills
The circuit of the summer hills,
Is—that his grave is green;
And deeply would their hearts rejoice
To hear again his living voice.
The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous—nothing could be more melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,
A feeling of sadness and longing
That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain.
The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as "The Health" of Edward Coote Pinkney:
I fill this cup to one made up
Of loveliness alone,
A woman, of her gentle sex
The seeming paragon;
To whom the better elements
And kindly stars have given
A form so fair, that like the air,
'Tis less of earth than heaven.

Her every tone is music's own,
Like those of morning birds,
And something more than melody
Dwells ever in her words;
The coinage of her heart are they,
And from her lips each flows
As one may see the burden'd bee
Forth issue from the rose.

Affections are as thoughts to her,
The measures of her hours;
Her feelings have the fragrancy,
The freshness of young flowers;
And lovely passions, changing oft,
So fill her, she appears
The image of themselves by turns,—
The idol of past years!

Of her bright face one glance will trace
A picture on the brain,
And of her voice in echoing hearts
A sound must long remain;
But memory, such as mine of her,
So very much endears,
When death is nigh my latest sigh
Will not be life's, but hers.

I fill'd this cup to one made up
Of loveliness alone,
A woman, of her gentle sex
The seeming paragon—
Her health! and would on earth there stood,
Some more of such a frame,
That life might be all poetry,
And weariness a name.
It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have been born too far south. Had he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing called The North American Review. The poem just cited is especially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet's enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.

It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the merits of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves. Boccalina, in his Advertisements from Parnassus, tells us that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book:—whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out all the chaff for his reward.

Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics—but I am by no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood. Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an axiom, which need only be properly put, to become self-evident. It is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such:—and thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit that they are not merits altogether.

Among the "Melodies" of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude to his lines beginning—"Come, rest in this bosom." The intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all in all of the divine passion of Love—a sentiment which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:
Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,
Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;
Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,
And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.

Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same
Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,
I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.

Thou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss,
And thy Angel I'll be,'mid the horrors of this,—
Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,
And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too!
It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while granting him Fancy—a distinction originating with Coleridge—than whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very naturally, the idea that he is fanciful only. But never was there a greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet. In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more profoundly—more weirdly imaginative, in the best sense, than the lines commencing— "I would I were by that dim lake"— which are the composition of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.

One of the noblest—and, speaking of Fancy—one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His "Fair Ines" had always for me an inexpressible charm:
O saw ye not fair Ines?
She's gone into the West,
To dazzle when the sun is down
And rob the world of rest
She took our daylight with her,
The smiles that we love best,
With morning blushes on her cheek,
And pearls upon her breast.

O turn again, fair Ines,
Before the fall of night,
For fear the moon should shine alone,
And stars unrivall'd bright;
And blessed will the lover be
That walks beneath their light,
And breathes the love against thy cheek
I dare not even write!

Would I had been, fair Ines,
That gallant cavalier,
Who rode so gaily by thy side,
And whisper'd thee so near!
Were there no bonny dames at home,
Or no true lovers here,
That he should cross the seas to win
The dearest of the dear?

I saw thee, lovely Ines,
Descend along the shore,
With bands of noble gentlemen,
And banners-waved before;
And gentle youth and maidens gay,
And snowy plumes they wore;
It would have been a beauteous dream,
If it had been no more!

Alas, alas, fair Ines,
She went away with song,
With Music waiting on her steps,
And shoutings of the throng;
But some were sad and felt no mirth,
But only Music's wrong,
In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,
To her you've loved so long.

Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,
That vessel never bore
So fair a lady on its deck,
Nor danced so light before,—
Alas for pleasure on the sea,
And sorrow on the shore!
The smile that blest one lover's heart
Has broken many more!
"The Haunted House," by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever written,—one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It is, moreover, powerfully ideal—imaginative. I regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated "Bridge of Sighs:"
One more Unfortunate,
Weary of breath,
Rashly importunate
Gone to her death!

Take her up tenderly,
Lift her with care;—
Fashion'd so slenderly,
Young and so fair!

Look at her garments
Clinging like cerements;
Whilst the wave constantly
Drips from her clothing;
Take her up instantly,
Loving, not loathing.

Touch her not scornfully
Think of her mournfully,
Gently and humanly;
Not of the stains of her,
All that remains of her
Now is pure womanly.

Make no deep scrutiny
Into her mutiny
Rash and undutiful;
Past all dishonor,
Death has left on her
Only the beautiful.

Where the lamps quiver
So far in the river,
With many a light
From window and casement,
From garret to basement,
She stood, with amazement,
Houseless by night.

The bleak wind of March
Made her tremble and shiver;
But not the dark arch,
Or the black flowing river:
Mad from life's history,
Glad to death's mystery,
Swift to be hurl'd—
Anywhere, anywhere
Out of the world!

In she plunged boldly,
No matter how coldly
The rough river ran,—
Over the brink of it,
Picture it,—think of it,
Dissolute Man!
Lave in it, drink of it
Then, if you can!

Still, for all slips of hers,
One of Eve's family—
Wipe those poor lips of hers
Oozing so clammily,
Loop up her tresses
Escaped from the comb,
Her fair auburn tresses;
Whilst wonderment guesses
Where was her home?

Who was her father?
Who was her mother!
Had she a sister?
Had she a brother?
Or was there a dearer one
Still, and a nearer one
Yet, than all other?

Alas! for the rarity
Of Christian charity
Under the sun!
Oh! it was pitiful!
Near a whole city full,
Home she had none.

Sisterly, brotherly,
Fatherly, motherly,
Feelings had changed:
Love, by harsh evidence,
Thrown from its eminence;
Even God's providence
Seeming estranged.

Take her up tenderly;
Lift her with care;
Fashion'd so slenderly,
Young, and so fair!
Ere her limbs frigidly
Stiffen too rigidly,
Decently,—kindly,—
Smooth and compose them;
And her eyes, close them,
Staring so blindly!

Dreadfully staring
Through muddy impurity,
As when with the daring
Last look of despairing
Fixed on futurity.

Perishing gloomily,
Spurred by contumely,
Cold inhumanity,
Burning insanity,
Into her rest,—
Cross her hands humbly,
As if praying dumbly,
Over her breast!
Owning her weakness,
Her evil behavior,
And leaving, with meekness,
Her sins to her Saviour!
The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The versification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem.

Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:
Though the day of my destiny's over,
And the star of my fate hath declined,
Thy soft heart refused to discover
The faults which so many could find;
Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
It shrunk not to share it with me,
And the love which my spirit hath painted
It never hath found but in thee.

Then when nature around me is smiling,
The last smile which answers to mine,
I do not believe it beguiling,
Because it reminds me of thine;
And when winds are at war with the ocean,
As the breasts I believed in with me,
If their billows excite an emotion,
It is that they bear me from thee.

Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
And its fragments are sunk in the wave,
Though I feel that my soul is delivered
To pain—it shall not be its slave.
There is many a pang to pursue me:
They may crush, but they shall not contemn—
They may torture, but shall not subdue me—
'Tis of thee that I think—not of them.

Though human, thou didst not deceive me,
Though woman, thou didst not forsake,
Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,—
Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
Though parted, it was not to fly,
Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,
Nor mute, that the world might belie.

Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,
Nor the war of the many with one—
If my soul was not fitted to prize it,
'Twas folly not sooner to shun:
And if dearly that error hath cost me,
And more than I once could foresee,
I have found that whatever it lost me,
It could not deprive me of thee.

From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,
Thus much I at least may recall,
It hath taught me that which I most cherished
Deserved to be dearest of all:
In the desert a fountain is springing,
In the wide waste there still is a tree,
And a bird in the solitude singing,
Which speaks to my spirit of thee.
Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification could scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman.

From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen. I call him, and think him the noblest of poets, not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profound—not because the poetical excitement which he induces is at all times the most intense—but because it is at all times the most ethereal—in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his last long poem, "The Princess:"
Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
Tears from the depth of some divine despair
Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
In looking on the happy Autumn fields,
And thinking of the days that are no more.

Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
That brings our friends up from the underworld,
Sad as the last which reddens over one
That sinks with all we love below the verge;
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds
To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

Dear as remember'd kisses after death,
And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd
On lips that are for others; deep as love,
Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
O Death in Life, the days that are no more.
Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my purpose to suggest that, while this Principle itself is strictly and simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the Principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul, quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary—Love —the true, the divine Eros—the Uranian as distinguished from the Dionasan Venus—is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest. We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the Poet himself the true poetical effect. He recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low shrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of tall eastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of clouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming of silver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroring depths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds, in the harp of Æolus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voice of the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh breath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at eventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts, in all unworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman, in the grace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice, in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning enthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional endurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the altogether divine majesty of her love.

Let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by Motherwell, and is called "The Song of the Cavalier." With our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier:
A steed! a steed! of matchless speede!
A sword of metal keene!
Al else to noble heartes is drosse—
Al else on earth is meane.
The neighynge of the war-horse prowde.
The rowleing of the drum,
The clangor of the trumpet lowde—
Be soundes from heaven that come.
And oh! the thundering presse of knightes,
When as their war-cryes welle,
May tole from heaven an angel bright,
And rowse a fiend from hell,
Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,
And don your helmes amaine,
Deathe's couriers, Fame and Honor, call
Us to the field againe.
No shrewish teares shall fill your eye
When the sword-hilt's in our hand,—
Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe
For the fayrest of the land;
Let piping swaine, and craven wight,
Thus weepe and puling crye,
Our business is like men to fight,
And hero-like to die!

The Philosophy of Composition

Charles Dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an examination I once made of the mechanism of Barnaby Rudge, says—"By the way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his Caleb Williams backwards? He first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second volume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of accounting for what had been done."

I cannot think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of Godwin—and indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in accordance with Mr. Dickens's idea—but the author of Caleb Williams was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at least a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that every plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its dénouement before anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the dénouement constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.

There is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a story. Either history affords a thesis—or one is suggested by an incident of the day—or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his narrative—-designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue, or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from page to page, render themselves apparent.

I prefer commencing with the consideration of an effect. Keeping originality always in view—for he is false to himself who ventures to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interest—I say to myself, in the first place, "Of the innumerable effects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or (more generally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion, select?" Having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid effect, I consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or tone—whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse, or by peculiarity both of incident and tone—afterwards looking about me (or rather within) for such combinations of events or tone as shall best aid me in the construction of the effect.

I have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would—that is to say, who could—detail, step by step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never been given to the world, I am much at a loss to say—but perhaps the autorial vanity has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause. Most writers—poets in especial—prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy—an ecstatic intuition—and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought—at the true purposes seized only at the last moment—at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view—at the fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable—at the cautious selections and rejections—at the painful erasures and interpolations,—in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for scene-shifting, the step-ladders and demon-traps, the cock's feathers, the red paint, and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred, constitute the properties of the literary histrio.

I am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his conclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisen pell-mell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner.

For my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to, nor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions; and, since the interest of an analysis, or reconstruction, such as I have considered a desideratum, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the modus operandi by which some one of my own works was put together. I select "The Raven" as most generally known. It is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referrible either to accident or intuition— that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.

Let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, per se, the circumstance—or say the necessity—which, in the first place, gave rise to the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste.

We commence, then, with this intention.

The initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression—for, if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and everything like totality is at once destroyed. But since, ceteris paribus, no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may advance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in extent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends it. Here I say no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones—that is to say, of brief poetical effects. It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one-half of the "Paradise Lost" is essentially prose—a succession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably, with corresponding depressions—the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of effect.

It appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards length, to all works of literary art—the limit of a single sitting—and that, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as Robinson Crusoe (demanding no unity), this limit may be advantageously overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within this limit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to its merit—in other words, to the excitement or elevation—again, in other words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is capable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effect—this, with one proviso—that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all.

Holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of excitement which I deemed not above the popular, while not below the critical taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper length for my intended poem—a length of about one hundred lines. It is, in fact, a hundred and eight.

My next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be conveyed: and here I may as well observe that, throughout the construction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work universally appreciable. I should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have repeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the slightest need of demonstration—the point, I mean, that Beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem. A few words, however, in elucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a disposition to misrepresent. That pleasure which is at once the most intense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, I believe, found in the contemplation of the beautiful. When, indeed, men speak of Beauty, they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect—they refer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of soul —not of intellect, or of heart—upon which I have commented, and which is experienced in consequence of contemplating "the beautiful." Now I designate Beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from direct causes— that objects should be attained through means best adapted for their attainment—no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem. Now the object Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the object Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable to a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose. Truth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion a homeliness (the truly passionate will comprehend me) which are absolutely antagonistic to that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable elevation, of the soul. It by no means follows from anything here said that passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably introduced, into a poem—for they may serve in elucidation, or aid the general effect, as do discords in music, by contrast—but the true artist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper subservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, as far as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem.

Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the tone of its highest manifestation—and all experience has shown that this tone is one of sadness. Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.

The length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, I betook myself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic piquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of the poem—some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn. In carefully thinking over all the usual artistic effects—or more properly points, in the theatrical sense—I did not fail to perceive immediately that no one had been so universally employed as that of the refrain. The universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic value, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis. I considered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of improvement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition. As commonly used, the refrain, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but depends for its impression upon the force of monotone—both in sound and thought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity—of repetition. I resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by adhering in general to the monotone of sound, while I continually varied that of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuously novel effects, by the variation of the application of the refrain—the refrain itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried.

These points being settled, I next bethought me of the nature of my refrain. Since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it was clear that the refrain itself must be brief, for there would have been an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in any sentence of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentence would of course be the facility of the variation. This led me at once to a single word as the best refrain.

The question now arose as to the character of the word. Having made up my mind to a refrain, the division of the poem into stanzas was of course a corollary, the refrain forming the close to each stanza. That such a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous vowel in connection with r as the most producible consonant.

The sound of the refrain being thus determined, it became necessary to select a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy which I had predetermined as the tone of the poem. In such a search it would have been absolutely impossible to overlook the word "Nevermore." In fact, it was the very first which presented itself.

The next desideratum was a pretext for the continuous use of the one word "nevermore." In observing the difficulty which I at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition, I did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the pre-assumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken by a human being—I did not fail to perceive, in short, that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word. Here, then, immediately arose the idea of a non-reasoning creature capable of speech; and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance, suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a Raven as equally capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended tone.

I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word "Nevermore" at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself—"Of all melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of mankind, is the most melancholy?" Death, was the obvious reply. "And when," I said, "is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?" From what I have already explained at some length, the answer here also is obvious—"When it most closely allies itself to Beauty; the death, then, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover."

I had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word "Nevermore." I had to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the application of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in answer to the queries of the lover. And here it was that I saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had been depending, that is to say, the effect of the variation of application. I saw that I could make the first query propounded by the lover—the first query to which the Raven should reply "Nevermore"—that I could make this first query a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and so on, until at length the lover, startled from his original nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its frequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and wildly propounds queries of a far different character—queries whose solution he has passionately at heart—propounds them half in superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in self-torture—propounds them not altogether because he believes in the prophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which reason assures him is merely repeating a lesson learned by rote), but because he experiences a frenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the expected "Nevermore" the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, I first established in mind the climax or concluding query—that query to which "Nevermore" should be in the last place an answer—that query in reply to which this word "Nevermore" should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair.

Here then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end where all works of art should begin; for it was here at this point of my preconsiderations that I first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza:
"Prophet," said I, "thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil!
By that heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore,
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
I composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the climax, I might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness, and importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that I might definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and general arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which were to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical effect. Had I been able in the subsequent composition to construct more vigorous stanzas, I should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect.

And here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My first object (as usual) was originality. The extent to which this has been neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in the world. Admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere rhythm, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite; and yet, for centuries, no man, in verse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original thing. The fact is that originality (unless in minds of very unusual force) is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or intuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and, although a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its attainment less of invention than negation.

Of course I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the "Raven." The former is trochaic—the latter is octametre acatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the refrain of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametre catalectic. Less pedantically, the feet employed throughout (trochees) consists of a long syllable followed by a short; the first line of the stanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half (in effect two-thirds), the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a half, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half. Now, each of these lines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality the "Raven" has, is in their combinations into stanzas; nothing even remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted. The effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and some altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the application of the principles of rhyme and alliteration.

The next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the lover and the Raven—and the first branch of this consideration was the locale. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest, or the fields—but it has always appeared to me that a close circumscription of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of insulated incident—it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has an indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of course, must not be confounded with mere unity of place.

I determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber —in a chamber rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it. The room is represented as richly furnished—this in mere pursuance of the ideas I have already explained on the subject of Beauty, as the sole true poetical thesis.

The locale being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird—and the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable. The idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a "tapping" at the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader's curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from the lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence adopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked.

I made the night tempestuous, first to account for the Raven's seeking admission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the (physical) serenity within the chamber.

I made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for the effect of contrast between the marble and the plumage—it being understood that the bust was absolutely suggested by the bird—the bust of Pallas being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the lover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas, itself.

About the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the force of contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression. For example, an air of the fantastic—approaching as nearly to the ludicrous as was admissible—is given to the Raven's entrance. He comes in "with many a flirt and flutter."
Not the least obeisance made he—not a moment stopped or stayed he,
But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door.
In the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried out:
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore? "
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as "Nevermore."
The effect of the dénouement being thus provided for, I immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness—this tone commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with the line,
But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc.
From this epoch the lover no longer jests—no longer sees anything even of the fantastic in the Raven's demeanor. He speaks of him as a "grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore," and feels the "fiery eyes" burning into his "bosom's core." This revolution of thought, or fancy, on the lover's part, is intended to induce a similar one on the part of the reader—to bring the mind into a proper frame for the dénouement—which is now brought about as rapidly and as directly as possible.

With the dénouement proper—with the Raven's reply, "Nevermore," to the lover's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another world—the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may be said to have its completion. So far, everything is within the limits of the accountable—of the real. A raven having learned by rote the single word "Nevermore," and having escaped from the custody of its owner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams—the chamber-window of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume, half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. The casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itself perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor's demeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its name. The Raven addressed, answers with its customary word, "Nevermore"—a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of "Nevermore." The student now guesses the state of the case, but is impelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst for self-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow through the anticipated answer "Nevermore." With the indulgence, to the extreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed its first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has been no overstepping of the limits of the real.

But in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an array of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which repels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required—first, some amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation; and, secondly, some amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite of meaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art so much of that richness (to borrow from colloquy a forcible term) which we are too fond of confounding with the ideal. It is the excess of the suggested meaning—it is the rendering this the upper instead of the under current of theme—which turns into prose (and that of the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called transcendentalists.

Holding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of the poem—their suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative which has preceded them. The undercurrent of meaning is rendered first apparent in the lines:
"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore!"
It will be observed that the words, "from out my heart," involve the first metaphorical expression in the poem. They, with the answer, "Nevermore," dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been previously narrated. The reader begins now to regard the Raven as emblematical—but it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of Mournful and never-ending Remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen:
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!

Old English Poetry1

It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed to what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry—we mean to the simple love of the antique—and that, again, a third of even the proper poetic sentiment inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions, would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy, wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the author's will, and is altogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems now—we mean it only as against the poets then. There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless, sincere and although very learned, still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the end—with the two latter the means. The poet of the "Creation" wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth—the poet of the "Ancient Mariner" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the "metaphysical verse" of Cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he was in this but a type of his school—for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their writings sprang immediately from the soul—and partook intensely of that soul's nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandon—to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind—but, again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one (ceteris paribus) more artificial.

We cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the "Book of Gems" are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the school—but if the intention had been merely to show the school's character, the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion, for example, of Sir Henry's Wotton's "Verses on the Queen of Bohemia"—that "there are few finer things in our language," is untenable and absurd.

In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without even an attempt at adaptation.

In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with "The Shepherd's Hunting" by Withers—a poem partaking, in a remarkable degree, of the peculiarities of Il Penseroso. Speaking of Poesy, the author says:
"By the murmur of a spring,
Or the least boughs rustleling,
By a daisy whose leaves spread,
Shut when Titan goes to bed,
Or a shady bush or tree,
She could more infuse in me
Than all Nature's beauties con
In some other wiser man.
By her help I also now
Make this churlish place allow
Something that may sweeten gladness
In the very gall of sadness—
The dull loneness, the black shade,
That these hanging vaults have made
The strange music of the waves
Beating on these hollow caves,
This black den which rocks emboss,
Overgrown with eldest moss,
The rude portals that give light
More to terror than delight,
This my chamber of neglect
Walled about with disrespect;
From all these and this dull air
A fit object for despair,
She hath taught me by her might
To draw comfort and delight."
But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in Corbet's "Farewell to the Fairies!" We copy a portion of Marvell's "Maiden lamenting for her Fawn," which we prefer—not only as a specimen of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness—to anything of its species:
"It is a wondrous thing how fleet
'Twas on those little silver feet,
With what a pretty skipping grace
It oft would challenge me the race,
And when't had left me far away
'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;
For it was nimbler much than hinds,
And trod as if on the four winds.
I have a garden of my own,
But so with roses overgrown,
And lilies, that you would it guess
To be a little wilderness;
And all the spring-time of the year
It only loved to be there.
Among the beds of lilies I
Have sought it oft where it should lie,
Yet could not, till itself would rise,
Find it, although before mine eyes.
For in the flaxen lilies shade
It like a bank of lilies laid;
Upon the roses it would feed
Until its lips even seemed to bleed,
And then to me 'twould boldly trip,
And print those roses on my lip,
But all its chief delight was still
With roses thus itself to fill,
And its pure virgin limbs to fold
In whitest sheets of lilies cold,
Had it lived long, it would have been
Lilies without, roses within."
How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It pervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words—over the gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself—even over the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favorite—like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, "and all sweet flowers." The whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief, or the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quoted—the wonder of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favorite—the "little silver feet"—the fawn challenging his mistress to a race with "a pretty skipping grace," running on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to fly from it again—can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,
"And trod as if on the four winds!"
a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then consider the garden of "my own," so overgrown, entangled with roses and lilies, as to be "a little wilderness"—the fawn loving to be there, and there "only"—the maiden seeking it "where it should lie"—and not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until "itself would rise"—the lying among the lilies "like a bank of lilies"—the loving to "fill itself with roses,"
"And its pure virgin limbs to fold
In whitest sheets of lilies cold,"
and these things being its "chief" delights—and then the pre-eminent beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child:
"Had it lived long, it would have been
Lilies without, roses within.


 
"I want to write pure movement."
This is not a lament, it’s the cry of a bird of prey. An
iridescent and restless bird. The kiss upon the dead face.
I write as if to save somebody’s life. Probably my own. Life is
a kind of madness that death makes. Long live the dead
because we live in them.
Suddenly things no longer need to make sense. I’m satisfied
with being. Are you? Certainly you are. The meaninglessness of
things makes me smile complacently. Everything surely must go
on being what it is.
Today is a day of nothing. Today is down to the wire. Could
there be a number that is nothing? that is less than zero? that
begins where there is no beginning because it always was? and
was before always? I tap into this vital absence and I’m a
young man again, both contained and complete. Round without
beginning or end, I am the point before the zero, before the
period of the sentence. From zero to infinity I walk without
stopping. But at the same time everything is so fleeting. I
always was and just as quickly was no longer. The day runs
along aimlessly outside and there are abysses of silence within
me. The shadow of my soul is my body. My body is the
shadow of my soul. This book is my shadow. Excuse me, may
I pass by? I feel guilty when I don’t obey you. I am happy at
the wrong moment. Unhappy when everyone’s dancing. I’ve
heard that cripples rejoice just as I’ve heard that the blind can
be glad. Because unhappy people make up for it somehow.
Life has never been as current as it is today: a hair’s breadth
from the future. Time for me means the dissolution of matter.
The rotting of the organic as if time were a worm robbing the
fruit of its pulp. Time does not exist. What we call time is the
movement of the evolution of things, but time itself does not
exist. Or it exists immutably and into time we transfer
ourselves. Time passes too quickly and life is so short. And so
— to avoid being swallowed by the voracity of the hours and
the news that makes time rush by — I cultivate a certain
tedium. That’s how I savor every loathsome minute. And I
cultivate too the empty silence of the eternity of our species. I
want to live many minutes within a single minute. I want to
multiply myself to take in even the desert regions that give the
idea of eternal immobility. In eternity time does not exist. Night
and day are opposites because they are both time and time
cannot be divided. From now on, time will always be the
current moment. Today is today. I’m stunned and at the same
time suspicious that I’ve been given so much. And tomorrow I
shall once again have a today. There is something painful and
pungent about living the today. The paroxysm of the highest
and sharpest note of an insistent violin. But then there’s habit
and habit numbs. The stinger of the bee in the flowering day
that is today. Thank God, I have enough to eat. Our daily
bread.
I wanted to write a book. But where are the words? all the
meanings have been exhausted. Like the deaf and the mute we
communicate with our hands. I wanted permission to write the
scraps of words while accompanied by a rustic harp. And to
dispense with being discursive. Like this: pollution.
Do I write or not?
To know when to quit. Whether to give up — this is often the
question facing the gambler. No one is taught the art of
walking away. And the anguish of deciding if I should keep
playing is hardly unusual. Will I be able to quit honorably? or
am I the type who waits stubbornly for something to happen?
something like, for instance, the end of the world? or whatever
it might be, maybe my own sudden death, in which case my
decision to give up would be beside the point.
I don’t want to race against myself. A fact. What becomes a
fact? Should I be interested in the event itself? Have I been
reduced to filling these pages with information about “facts”?
Should I make up a story or do I allow my chaotic inspiration
free rein? There’s so much false inspiration. And when real
inspiration arrives and I don’t realize it? Would it be too
horrible to want to move closer to the lucid self within? Yes,
and it’s when the self no longer exists, no longer makes
demands, that it joins the tree of life — and that’s what I
struggle to attain. To forget oneself and yet to live so intensely.
I’m afraid to write. It’s so dangerous. Anyone who’s tried,
knows. The danger of stirring up hidden things — and the
world is not on the surface, it’s hidden in its roots submerged
in the depths of the sea. In order to write I must place myself
in the void. In this void is where I exist intuitively. But it’s a
terribly dangerous void: it’s where I wring out blood. I’m a
writer who fears the snares of words: the words I say hide
others — which? maybe I’ll say them. Writing is a stone cast
down a deep well.
A light and gentle meditation on the nothing. I write almost
completely free of my body. As if levitating. My spirit is empty
because of so much happiness. I’m feeling an intimate freedom
comparable only to riding a horse through the fields without
any destination. I’m free of destiny. Perhaps my destiny is to
reach freedom? there’s no wrinkle on my soul spreading out in
delicate froth. No longer am I being assailed. And it’s delightful.
I’m hearing music. Debussy uses the froth of the sea dying on
the sands, ebbing and flowing. Bach is a mathematician. Mozart
is the impersonal divine. Chopin reveals his most intimate life.
Schoenberg, through his self, reaches the classical self of
everyone. Beethoven is the stormy human elixir searching for
divinity and only finding it in death. As for me, I’ve got
nothing to do with music, I only arrive at the threshold of a
new word. Without the courage to expose it. My vocabulary is
sad and sometimes Wagnerian-polyphonic-paranoid. I write very
simple and very naked. That’s why it wounds. I’m a gray and
blue landscape. I rise in a dry fountain and in the cold light.
I want to write squalidly and structurally as though with the
acute angles of a rigid, enigmatic triangle plotted with ruler and
compass.
Does “writing” exist in and of itself? No. It is merely the
reflection of a thing that questions. I work with the unexpected.
I write the way I do without knowing how and why — it’s the
fate of my voice. The timbre of my voice is me. Writing is a
query. It’s this: ?
Could I be betraying myself? Could I be altering the course of
a river? I must trust that abundant river. Or maybe I’m
damming a river? I try to open the flood-gates, I want to
watch the water gushing out. I want every sentence of this
book to be a climax.
I must be patient for the fruits will be surprising.
This is a quiet book. And it speaks, it speaks softly.
This is a fresh book — recently emerged from nothingness. It
is played delicately and confidently on the piano and every note
is clean and perfect, each distinct from the others. This book is
a carrier pigeon. I write for nothing and for no one. Anyone
who reads me does so at his own risk. I don’t make
literature: I simply live in the passing of time. The act of
writing is the inevitable result of my being alive. I lost sight of
myself so long ago that I’m hesitant to try to find myself. I’m
afraid to begin. Existing sometimes gives me heart palpitations.
I’m so afraid to be me. I’m so dangerous. They gave me a
name and alienated me from myself.
I feel as though I’m still not writing. I foresee and want a way
of speaking that’s more fanciful, more precise, with more
rapture, making spirals in the air.
Each new book is a journey. But a journey with eyes covered
thro’ seas never before discovered — the muzzle on the eyes,
the terror of the dark is total. When I feel an inspiration, I die
of fear because I know that once again I’ll be traveling alone
in a world that repels me. But my characters are not to blame
and I treat them as best I can. They arrive from nowhere.
They are inspiration. Inspiration is not madness. It’s God. My
problem is the fear of going mad. I have to control myself.
There are laws that govern communication. Impersonality is one
condition. Separativity and ignorance are sin in a general sense.
And madness is the temptation to be totally power. My
limitations are the raw material to be worked as long as I
don’t reach my objective.
I live in the living flesh, that’s why I make such an effort to
give thick skin to my characters. But I can’t stand it and make
them cry for no reason.
Self-moving roots that are not planted or the root of a tooth?
For I too cast off my chains: I kill what disturbs me and good
and evil disturb me and I head definitively to encounter a
world that is inside me, I who write to free myself from the
difficult burden of a person being himself.
In every word a heart beats. Writing is that search for the
intimate truth of life. Life that disturbs me and leaves my own
trembling heart suffering the incalculable pain that seems
necessary for my maturity — maturity? I’ve lived this long
without it!
Yes. But it seems the time has come to fully accept the
mysterious life of those who one day shall die. I must begin by
accepting myself and not feeling the punitive horror of every
time I fall, for when I fall the human race inside me falls too.
To accept myself fully? that is a violation of my very life. Every
change, every new project is scary: my heart is scared. And
that is why each word of mine has a heart where blood flows.
Everything I’m writing here is forged in my silence and in
shadows. I see little, I hear almost nothing. I finally dive into
myself down to the birthplace of the spirit that inhabits me. My
source is obscure. I’m writing because I don’t know what to
do with myself. I mean: I don’t know what to do with my
spirit. The body tells a lot. But I don’t know the laws of the
spirit: it wanders. My thought, with the enunciation of the
words mentally blossoming, without my saying or writing
anything afterwards — this thought of mine in words is
preceded by an instantaneous vision, without words, of the
thought — the word that follows, almost immediately — a
spatial difference of less than a millimeter. Before thinking, then,
I’ve already thought. I suppose that the composer of a
symphony only has the “thought before the thought,” is what
can be seen in this very quick mute idea little more than an
atmosphere? No. It’s actually an atmosphere that, already
colored with the symbol, lets me sense the air of the
atmosphere from which everything comes. The pre-thought is in
black and white. The thought with words has other colors. The
pre-thought is the pre-instant. The pre-thought is the immediate
past of the instant. Thinking is the concretization, materialization
of what was pre-thought. Really pre-thinking is what guides us,
since it’s intimately linked to my mute unconsciousness. The
pre-thought is not rational. It’s almost virginal.
Sometimes the feeling of pre-thinking is agonizing: it’s the
tortuous creation that thrashes in the shadows and is only
freed after thinking — with words.
You demand from me a tremendous effort of writing; please, I
beg your pardon, my dear, allow me to pass by. I am a
serious and honest man and if I don’t tell the truth it’s
because the truth is forbidden. I don’t put what’s forbidden to
use but I free it. Things obey the vital breath. We are born to
enjoy. And enjoying is already being born. When we were
fetuses we enjoyed the total comfort of the maternal womb. As
for me, I know nothing. What I have enters me through my
skin and makes me act sensually. I want the truth which is
only given to me though its opposite, through its untruth. And
I can’t stand everyday life. That must be why I write. My life
is one single day. And that’s how the past for me is present
and future. All in a single dizziness. And the sweetness is such
that it causes an unbearable itch in the soul. Living is magical
and wholly inexplicable. I understand death better. Being
everyday is an addiction. What am I? I’m a thought. Do I
have the breath within me? do I? but who does? who speaks
for me? do I have a body and a spirit? am I an I? “That’s
exactly right, you are an I,” the world answers me terribly.
And I am horrified. God must never be thought because either
He flees or I do. God must be ignored and felt. Then He acts.
I wonder: why does God demand our love? possible answer:
so that we might love ourselves and in loving ourselves, forgive
ourselves. And how we need forgiveness. Because life itself
already comes muddled with error.
The result of all this is that I’ll have to create a character —
more or less as novelists do, and through this character
understand. Because I cannot do it alone: solitude, the same
that exists in every one, makes me invent. And is there
another way to be saved? besides creating one’s own realities?
I have the strength for this like anybody else — isn’t it true
that we ended up creating a fragile and mad reality that is
civilization? this civilization guided only by dreams. Every
invention of mine sounds to me like a layman’s prayer — such
is the intensity of feeling, I write to learn. I chose myself and
my character — Angela Pralini — so that perhaps through us I
might understand that lack of definition of life. Life has no
adjective. It’s a mixture in a strange crucible but that allows
me in the end, to breathe. And sometimes to pant. And
sometimes to gasp. Yes. But sometimes there is also the deep
breath that finds the cold delicateness of my spirit, bound to
my body for now.
I wanted to initiate an experiment and not just be the victim
of an experiment I never authorized, that merely happened.
That’s why I’m inventing a character. I also want to shatter,
not just the enigma of the character, the enigma of things.
This I suppose will be a book made apparently out of shards
of a book. But in fact it is about portraying quick flashes of
mine and quick flashes of my character Angela. I could grab
onto every flash and go on about it page after page. But it so
happens that the essence of the thing is often in the flash.
Each entry in my diary and in the diary I made Angela write,
scares me a little. Each entry is written in the present. The
instant is already made of fragments. I don’t want to give a
false future to each flash of an instant. Everything happens
exactly at the moment in which it’s being written or read. This
passage here was actually written in relation to its basic form
after I reread the book because as the book progressed I
didn’t have a clear understanding as to which way to go. Yet,
without giving greater logical explanations, I clung entirely to the
fragmentary aspect in Angela as in myself.
My life is made of fragments and that’s how it is with Angela.
My own life has an actual plot. It would be the history of the
bark of a tree and not of the tree. A bunch of facts that only
the senses would explain. I see that, without meaning to, what
I write and what Angela writes are passages that might be
called random, though within a context of . . .
That’s how the book occurs to me this time. And, since I
respect what comes from me to myself, that’s exactly how I
write.
What is written here, mine or Angela’s, are the remains of a
demolition of soul, they are lateral cuts of a reality that
constantly escapes me. These fragments of book mean that I
work in ruins.
I know that this book isn’t easy, but it’s easy only for those
who believe in the mystery. As I write it I do not know myself,
I forget myself. The I who appears in this book is not I. It is
not autobiographical, you all know nothing of me. I never have
told you and never shall tell you who I am. I am all of
yourselves. I took from this book only what I wanted — I left
out my story and Angela’s. What matters to me are the
snapshots of sensations — sensations that are thought and not
the immobile pose of those waiting for me to say, “say cheese!”
Because I’m no street photographer.
I’ve already read this book through to the end and I’m adding
to this beginning something for you to keep in mind. It’s that
the end, which shouldn’t be read beforehand, comes back to
the beginning in a circle, a snake swallowing its own tail. And,
having read the book, I cut much more than half of it, I only
left what provokes and inspires me for life: a star lit at dusk.
Do not read what I write as a reader would do. Unless this
reader works, he too, on the soliloquies of the irrational dark.
If this book ever comes out, may the profane recoil from it.
Since writing is something sacred where no infidel can enter. I
am making a really bad book on purpose in order to drive off
the profane who want to “like.” But a small group will see that
this “liking” is superficial and will enter inside what I am truly
writing, which is neither “bad” nor “good.”
Inspiration is like a mysterious scent of amber. I have a small
piece of amber with me. The scent makes me sister to the
sacred orgies of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.
Blessed be your loves. Could it be that I am afraid to take the
step of dying at this very instant? Careful not to die. Yet I am
already in the future. This future of mine that shall be for you
the past of someone dead. When you have finished this book
cry a hallelujah for me. When you close the last page of this
frustrated and dauntless and playful book of life then forget
me. May God bless you then and this book ends well. That I
might at last find respite. May peace be upon us, upon you,
and upon me. Am I falling into discourse? may the temple’s
faithful forgive me: I write and that way rid myself of me and
then at last I can rest.
The Daydream Is What Reality Is
ANGELA
 
The last word will be the fourth dimension.
Length: her speaking
Width: beyond thought
Depth: my speaking of her, of facts and feelings and of her
beyond-thought.
I must be legible almost in the dark.
I had a vivid and inexplicable dream: I dreamed I was playing
with my reflection. But my reflection wasn’t in a mirror, but
reflected somebody else who wasn’t me.
Was it because of this dream that I invented Angela as my
reflection? Everything is real but moves lei-sure-ly in slow
motion. Or it jumps from one theme to another, disconnected.
If I uproot myself I expose my roots to wind and rain. Brittle.
And not like blue granite and the stone of Iansã without cracks
or fissures. Angela for now has a swathe of fabric over her
face that hides her identity.
As she speaks she begins removing this swathe — until her
face is naked. Her face speaks unpolished and expressive.
Before unmasking her I shall cleanse the air with rain and
prepare the soil for plowing.
I will avoid sinking into the whirlpool of her river of liquid gold
glimmering with emeralds. Her mud is reddish. Angela is a
statue that cries out and flutters around the canopy of the
trees. Her world is only as unreal as the life of anyone who
happens to read me. I raise high the lantern so she can
glimpse the road that is a wrong turn. Stupefied and with
uninhibited joy I watch her rise with a ruffling of wings.
To create her I must plow the land. Is there some breakdown
in the computer system of my ship while it crosses spaces in
search of a woman? a computer made of pure silicon, with the
equivalent of thousands of microscopic transistors fixed to its
polished and gleaming surface with the noonday sun beating
down in a mirror, Angela is a mirror.
I want her to be the means by which the highest axioms of
mathematics are solved within a fraction of a second. I want to
calculate through her the answer to seven times the square
root of 15 to the third power. (The exact figure is
406.663325.)
Angela’s brain is embedded in a protective layer of plastic that
makes it practically indestructible — after I die Angela will keep
vibrating. A statue always being relocated by the crazed
disturbing buzz of three thousand golden bees. An angel
carried by blue butterflies? An angel isn’t born and doesn’t die.
An angel is a spiritual state. I sculpted her with twisted roots.
It’s only out of impudence that Angela exists in me. As for me
I reduce everything to a tumult of words.
We are all sentenced to death. While I write I might die. One
day I shall die amidst random facts.
— It was God who invented me and gave His breath to me
and I became a living being. And so it is that I present to
myself a person. And therefore I think that I am sufficiently
born to try to express myself even if with rough words. It’s
my interior that speaks and sometimes without connection to
my conscious mind. I speak as though someone were speaking
for me. Perhaps the reader speaks for me?
I do not remember my previous life, since I have the result
which is today. But I remember tomorrow.
How shall I begin?
I’m so frightened that the way to enter this writing has to be
suddenly, without warning. Writing is without warning. So I
start with the instant like someone throwing himself into suicide:
the instant is all of a sudden. And so it is that I’ve all of a
sudden arrived in the middle of a celebration. I’m flustered and
apprehensive: it’s not easy to deal with Angela, the woman I
invented because I needed a facsimile of dialogue. An accursed
celebration? No, the celebration of a man who wishes to share
with you, Angela, something that absorbs me completely.
Angela Pralini is the celebration of birth. I don’t know what to
expect from her: will I just have to transcribe her? I must be
patient so as not to lose myself within me: I live losing sight of
myself. I need patience because I am many paths, including the
fatal dead-end alley. I am a man who chose the great silence.
Creating a being who stands in opposition to me is within the
silence. A spiraling clarinet. A dark cello. But I manage to see,
however dimly, Angela standing beside me. Here she is coming
a little closer. Then she sits by my side, rests her face in her
hands and weeps for having been created. I console her
making her understand that I too feel the vast and shapeless
melancholy of having been created. I’d rather have stayed in
the immanescence of the sacred Nothing. But there is a
wisdom of nature that caused me, after being created, to move
about even though I didn’t know what my legs were for.
Angela, I too made my home in a strange nest and I too
obey the obstinacy of life. My life wants me to be a writer and
so I write. It’s not by choice: it’s an intimate command.
And just as I received the breath of life that made me a man,
I breathe into you who become a soul. I introduce you to
myself, visualizing you in snapshots that already happen in the
midst of your inauguration: you don’t start at the beginning,
you start in the middle, you begin with the instant today.
The day begins. The day is a crusher of paving-stones for the
street that I hear in my room. I wanted in my way of nailing
you down for myself for nothing to have modifications or
definitions: everything would move in a circular motion.
Sometimes I feel that Angela is electronic. Is she a
high-precision machine or a test-tube baby? Is she made of
screws and springs? Or is she the living half of me? Angela is
more than I myself. Angela doesn’t know she’s a character.
Besides I too might be the character of myself. Could it be
Angela feels that she’s a character? Because, as for me, I
sometimes feel that I am someone’s character. It’s
uncomfortable being two: me for me and me for others. I live
in my hermitage which I only leave to exist in myself: Angela
Pralini. Angela is my necessity. But I still don’t know why
Angela lives in a kind of constant prayer. A pagan prayer.
Ever-new excommunicated terrors. She’s achieved a native
language.
Angela doesn’t know herself, and she has no clear image of
herself. There is a disconnection in her. She confuses in herself
the “for-me” with the “from-me”! If she weren’t so dumbstruck
and paralyzed by her own existence, she would also see herself
from the outside in — and would discover that she is a
voracious person: she eats with an intemperance bordering on
complete greed as if bread were being taken from her very
mouth. But she believes she’s merely dainty.
I’m sculpting Angela with stones from the hillsides, until I shape
her into a statue. Then I breathe into her and she becomes
animated and surpasses me.
You must not forget that I am basically different from Angela.
Aside from everything else, the man I am, he tries anxiously in
vain to follow the byzantine meanderings of a woman, with
attics and corners and angles and living flesh — and suddenly
spontaneous as a flower. I as a writer cast seeds. Angela
Pralini was born of an ancient seed that I cast upon the hard
soil millennia ago. To arrive at me were millennia upon the
earth necessary?
How far do I go and where do I already start to be Angela?
Are we fruit of the same tree? No — Angela is everything I
wanted to be and never was. What is she? she’s the waves of
the sea. While I’m the dense and gloomy forest. I’m in the
depths. Angela scatters in sparkling fragments. Angela is my
vertigo. Angela is my reverberation, being an emanation of
mine, she is I. I, the author: the unknown. It’s by mere
coincidence that I am I. Angela seems like something intimate
that became exteriorized. Angela is not a “character.” She’s the
evolution of a feeling. She’s an idea incarnated in the being. In
the beginning there was only the idea. Then the word came
into contact with the idea. And then the word was no longer
mine: it transcended me, it was everyone’s, it was Angela’s.
I’ve always wanted to find someday a person who would live
for me because life is so full of useless things that I can only
bear it through extreme muscular asthenia, I suffer from moral
indolence in living. I tried to make Angela live in my place —
but she too wants only the climax of life.
Maybe I created Angela in order to have a dialogue with
myself? I invented Angela because I need to invent myself —
Angela is a startled woman.
All I know I cannot prove. What I imagine is real, or else on
what basis could I imagine Angela, who roars, bellows, moans,
pants, bleating and growling and grunting.
I feel as though I’ve already secretly achieved what I wanted
and I still don’t know what I achieved. Could that be the
somewhat dubious and elusive thing vaguely called “experience”?
AUTHOR: I fear when the earth was formed. What a
tremendous cosmic boom.
Through layer upon subterranean layer I reach the first man
created. I reach the past of others. I recall this infinite and
impersonal past which is without intelligence: it’s organic and
it’s what worries me. I didn’t begin with myself when I was
born. I began when the slow dinosaurs had begun. Or better
yet: nothing begins. It’s like this: only when man takes notice
through his simple gaze does a beginning appear to him. Yet
— I give the appearance of contradiction — I already began
many times. I’m beginning right now. As for Angela, she was
born with me now, she strains to exist. Except I’m marginalized
despite having a wife and kids — marginalized because I write.
For instead of following the already-opened road I took a
detour. Detours are dangerous. Whereas Angela is compliant
and social.
Angela has within her water and desert, populace and
hermitage, abundance and neediness, fear and defiance. She
has within her eloquence and absurd muteness, surprise and
antiquity, refinement and crudeness. She’s baroque.
I extract my feelings and words from my absolute night.
The difference between me and Angela can be felt. I cloistered
in my narrow, anguished little world, not knowing how to leave
to breathe in the beauty of what’s outside me. Angela, agile,
graceful, full of the ringing of bells. I, seemingly bound to a
destiny. Angela with the lightness of someone who has no end.
Angela is continually being made and has no obligations to her
own life or to literature or any art, she’s purposeless.
Angela consoles herself for existing by thinking: “I at least have
the advantage of being me, and not some random stranger.”
I tame Angela. I have to cross mountains and desolate areas,
flattened by cyclonic storms, inundated by torrential rains and
scorched by a high and voracious sun as merciless as ideal
justice. I traverse this woman like a ghost train, across hills
and valleys, through sleeping cities. My hope is to find the
slightest hint of an answer. I advance with caution.
— I know that in Montserrat — mountains of intimate comfort
and pure solitude — some ceramic objects were found from
the Stone Age and the Bronze Age, and the skeletons of two
Iberians, the people who primitively inhabited the region. This
awakens an excited soul that flickers within me at the mercy of
unfettered winds. I wish I could make Angela aware of it but I
don’t know how to fit into her life this knowledge that implies
an exit from oneself into the terrain that is clear and of pure
information. Precious information that situates me millennia ago
and fascinates me with the dryness of the communication of
the phrase.
Cold and stupefying.
I imagined the clear sound of drops of water falling into water
— except that this minimal, delicate noise would be amplified
beyond sound, in enormous crystalline drops with a wet ringing
of bells sinking. In the cold and stupefying air the statues
asleep.
I am writing by groping along.
Could it be I really know that I am I? This question arises
because I notice that Angela doesn’t seem to know herself. She
doesn’t realize that there is a center inside her and that it’s
hard as a nut. From which words radiate. Phosphorescent.
Dejection. The taste of a crushed cigarette.
Sensation is the soul of the world. Is intelligence a sensation?
In Angela it is.
I recognize that my imitators are better than I am. Imitation is
more refined than raw authenticity. I am under the impression
that I’ve been imitating myself a bit. The worst plagiarism is
plagiarizing yourself. The struggle is hard: if I am weak I shall
die. As for Angela, I must say that I know perfectly well that
she’s only a character. I’m absolutely lucid and can speak with
some objectivity. But what I don’t understand is why I
invented Angela Pralini. It was to deceive someone. Perhaps.
The little popularity I have displeases me. And then there are
my imitators. But what about me? What style should I turn to
if I’ve already been so used and handled by some people who
had the bad taste of being me? I’ll write a book so closed that
it will only allow passage to a few. Or perhaps I’ll never write
again. I know nothing. The future — as Angela would say —
weighs down on me by the ton. I’m lost on this Sunday that’s
neither hot nor cold, having already taken refuge in a movie
theater.
Could my fatal darkness be the promise of an also-fatal light?
It so happens that I fear the fatal light and already have a
certain intimacy with the dark.
I’ve left the territory of the human and therefore left Angela
too. I transcended myself with a certain degree of muteness
and deafness: I’m living by a thread.
I wished
AUTHOR: I am the author of a woman I invented and to
whom I gave the name Angela Pralini. I got along well with
her. But she started to disturb me and I saw that once again
I’d have to take on the role of writer in order to put Angela
into words because only then can I communicate with her.
I write one book and Angela writes another: I’ve removed the
superfluous from both.
I write at midnight because I am dark. Angela writes by day
because she is almost always happy light.
This is a book of non-memoirs. It is happening right now, it
doesn’t matter when this right now was or is or shall be. It’s
a book like sleeping deep and dreaming intensely — but there’s
an instant when you awaken, sleep fades away, and only a
taste of dream remains in the mouth and in the body, only
the certainty of having slept and dreamt remains. I do
everything possible to write by chance. I want the phrase to
happen. I don’t know how to express myself in words. What I
feel is not translatable. I express myself better through silence.
Expressing myself through words is a challenge. But I’m not
up to the challenge. Poor words emerge. And what is the
secret word? I don’t know and why do I dare? Do I not
know just because I don’t dare say it?
I am well aware that I am in the dark and feed myself with
my own vital darkness. Is my darkness a larva that has inside
it perhaps a butterfly? It’s so dark that I’ve gone blind. I
simply can’t write anymore. I’ll let Angela talk for a few days.
As for me I think . . .
ANGELA: Living leaves me atremble.
AUTHOR: For me too life makes me shiver.
ANGELA: I feel anxious and afflicted.
AUTHOR: I see that Angela doesn’t quite know how to start.
Being born is difficult. Should I advise her to talk more easily
about facts? I’m going to teach her to start in the middle. She
must stop being so hesitant because otherwise this whole book
will be atremble, a drop of water dangling about to fall and
when it falls it divides in splinters of scattered droplets. Take
courage, Angela, start without paying too much attention.
ANGELA: . . . and I ask myself whether I’m about to die.
Because I write almost in a death rattle and feel dilacerated as
in a final farewell.
AUTHOR: Is this ultimately a dialogue or a double diary? I
only know one thing: at this moment I’m writing: “at this
moment” is a rare thing because only sometimes do I step
with both feet on the land of the present: usually one foot
slides toward the past, the other slides toward the future. And
I end up with nothing.
Angela is my attempt to be two. Unfortunately, however,
because of the way things are, we resemble one another and
she too writes because the only thing I know anything about is
the act of writing. (Though I don’t write: I speak.)
I did a quick inventory of my possessions and reached the
frightening conclusion that the only thing we have that hasn’t
been taken from us yet: our own names. Angela Pralini, a
name as gratuitous as yours and which became the title of my
trembling identity. Where will this identity lead me? What do I
do with myself? Since not a single act symbolizes me.
ANGELA: Astronomy leads me to a star of God.
It rises in pure incense that shatters in words of glass.
AUTHOR: My not-I is magnificent and surpasses me. Yet she
is I to me.
ANGELA: I was born amalgamated with the solitude of this
exact moment and which is so drawn out, and so deep, that it
is no longer my solitude but the Solitude of God. I finally
reached the moment in which nothing exists. Not even
tenderness from me to myself: this solitude is of the desert.
The wind for company. Ah but what a dark cold it brings. I
cover myself with soft melancholy, and gently rock back and
forth, back and forth, back and forth. Like that. Yes! Just like
that.
AUTHOR: Angela’s words are anti-words: they come from an
abstract place inside her where one doesn’t think, that dark
and vague and dripping place like a primitive cave. Angela,
unlike me, rarely reasons: she just believes.
Now because I’m afraid to write, I let you speak, even
inconsequentially as I made you. Here you are, in your crazy
unintelligible dialogue with me:
ANGELA: I, frightened gazelle and yellow butterfly. I’m no
more than a comma in life. I who am a colon. Thou, thou art
my exclamation. I breathe myself thee.
I am oblique like the flight of birds. Intimidated, without
strength, without hope, without warning, without news — I
tremble — I tremble—all over. I cast a sidelong glance at
myself.
What an effort I make to be myself. I struggle against a tide
in a boat with just enough room for my two feet in a perilous
and fragile balance.
Living is an act I did not premeditate. I blossomed from the
dark. I am only valid for myself. I must live little by little, it’s
no good living everything at once. In someone’s arms I die
completely. I am transformed into energy that has within it the
nuclear atomic. I’m the result of having heard a warm voice
long ago and having stepped off the train almost before it
stopped — haste is the enemy of perfection and that’s how I
ran toward the city missing immediately the station and the
train’s next departure and its exceptional moment that awakens
such a painful fright which is the whistle of the train, which is
farewell.
AUTHOR: Here she is talking as though with me but she talks
to the air and not even to herself and only I can take
advantage of what she says because she is from me and to
me.
Angela is my most brittle character. If she even manages to be
a character: it’s one more example of life beyond-writing like
life-beyond-death and beyond-word.
Do I love Angela, because she says what I don’t have the
courage to say because I am afraid of myself? or because I
think speaking is useless? Because what you speak is lost like
breath that leaves the mouth when you speak and that bit of
breath is lost forever.
ANGELA: I love you as much as if I were always bidding you
farewell. When I’m too alone, I fasten rattles to my ankles and
wrists. That way almost all my thoughts are externalized and
return to me as replies. My slightest energy makes them
vibrate immediately in a quiver of light and sound. I have to
be my friend or else I can’t bear the solitude. When I am
alone I try not to think because I am afraid of suddenly
thinking a thing too new for myself. To speak out loud alone
and to “what” is to address the world, it’s to create a powerful
voice that achieves — achieves what? The answer: it achieves
the “what.” “What” is the sacred sanctity of the universe.
AUTHOR: Neither do I know how to not-think. It happens
without effort. It’s only hard when I try to obtain that silent
darkness. When I’m distracted, I fall into shadow and into the
hollow and into the sweet and into the smooth nothing-of-me. I
refresh myself. And I believe. I believe in magic, then. I know
how to create within me an atmosphere of the miraculous. I
concentrate without any object in mind — and I feel myself
taken by a light. It’s a gratuitous miracle, without form and
without meaning — like the air that I inhale deeply until I get
dizzy for a few seconds. A miracle is the crux of living. When
I think, I ruin everything. That’s why I avoid thinking: all I
really do is go on going on. And without questions about why
or whither. If I think, a thing doesn’t turn up, I don’t happen.
A thing that certainly is free to go as long as it’s not
imprisoned by thought.
ANGELA: I take deep pleasure in prayer — and making
intimate and intense contact with the mysterious life of God.
There is nothing in the world that can substitute the joy of
prayer.
Today I swept the terrace where I keep my plants. How good
it is to handle the things of this world: the dry leaves, the
pollen of things (dust is the daughter of things). My daily life is
very adorned.
I’m being profoundly happy.
AUTHOR: Speak, Angela, speak even without making sense,
speak so that I won’t completely die.
ANGELA: I’m in agony: I want the colorful, confused and
mysterious mixture of nature. All the plants and algae, bacteria,
invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals
concluding man with his secrets.
AUTHOR: I’m going on holiday from myself and letting Angela
do the talking. If one day I should read these things I’m
writing, I want to find in the black pit of night thousands of
mute fireworks but accompanied by the splinters of thousands
of singing crystals. That is the dark night I want to find one
day outside me and within. Angela has just made me suddenly
feel something within and I felt happy. Extremely happy, I
don’t know why. Do I accept it? No, for some secret reason I
feel a great burden of uneasiness and anxiety when I reach
the snowy peak of a happiness-light. The too-purified air hurts
my body.
Angela has wings.
ANGELA: I really like things I don’t understand: when I read
a thing I don’t understand I feel a sweet and abysmal vertigo.
AUTHOR: When I was a person, and not yet this rigorous
being filled with words, I was more misunderstood by me. But
I accepted myself as a whole. But the word slowly kept
demystifying me and forcing me not to lie. I can still
sometimes lie to others. But as for me my innocence ended
and I am dealing more with an obscure reality that I nearly,
nearly grasp. It’s a secret truth, sealed, and I sometimes get
lost in its fleeting aspect. I am only worthwhile as a discovery.
ANGELA: I’m an actress to myself. I pretend that I am a
particular person but in reality I am nothing.
AUTHOR: I thought that a seven-pointed polyhedron could be
divided into seven equal parts within a circle. But I don’t fit. I
am outside. Is it my fault if I don’t have access to myself?
ANGELA: I don’t fall into the foolishness of being sincere.
AUTHOR: Anyway, Angela, what is it that you do?
ANGELA: I take care of life.
The great night of the world when there was no life.
AUTHOR: Angela represents the only person she is: there only
exists one Angela. Not a single act of mine is I. Angela shall
be the act that represents me.
I lost sight of my destiny. My asking is never exhausted. I ask.
What do I ask for? This: the possibility of eternally asking. I
have no mission: I live because I was born. And I shall die
without death symbolizing me. Outside of me I am Angela.
Inside of me I am anonymous. Living demands such audacity.
I feel as lost as if sleeping in the desert of the Treasury
Department.
— Angela, now I am speaking directly to you and ask you for
the love of God to cry already. Do, please, give your consent
and cry. Because, as for me, I can’t stand waiting any longer.
Scream out in pain! A red scream! And the tears burst the
flood-gates and wash a tired face. Wash as if they were
morning dew.
ANGELA: Am I pure?
AUTHOR: Purity would be as violent as the color white. Angela
is the color of hazelnut.
I have a great need to live from much poverty of spirit and
not have any luxury of soul. Angela is luxury and upsets me. I
will move away from her and enter a monastery, which is to
say, become poor. I chose today to wear some very old
trousers and a torn shirt. I feel good dressed in rags, I am
nostalgic for poverty. I ate only fruit and eggs, I refused the
rich blood of meat, I wanted to eat only what’s born without
agony, just blossoming naked like the egg, like the grape.
I didn’t sleep with my wife last night because a woman is
luxury and extravagance, and makes me into two, and I want
to be only one in order not to be a number divisible by any
other. I drank water while fasting. And slowly entered my own
and immeasurable and infinite desert. When in this desert my
penury becomes intolerable — I create Angela as a mirage,
illusion of optics and spirit, but I must abstain from Angela
because she is a richness of soul.
Just now I wanted to make Angela paint.
ANGELA: I’m painting a picture with the name “Meaningless.”
They are random things — objects and beings without any
connection, like a butterfly and a sewing machine.
[Author narrating the facts of Angela’s life]
I’ll run through the facts as quickly as possible because I’m in
a hurry. The most secret of meditations awaits me.
To write I begin by stripping myself of words. I prefer the
poor words left over.
I’ll give a quick biographical sketch of Angela Pralini: quickly
because facts and particulars bore me. So let’s see: born in
Rio de Janeiro, 34 years old, five foot six and of good family
though the daughter of poor parents. Married an industrialist,
etc.
ANGELA: I am as individual as a passport. I’ve got a police
record. Should I be proud to be part of the world or does it
discredit me?
AUTHOR: There’s something sweet in Angela’s eyes, something
reckless, a humid velvet, dull pearls but brown and sometimes
hard like two chestnuts. Sometimes she has eyes like those of
a cow being milked. Sweaty eyes. A glittering and mellifluous
bee that hovers above me in search of my honey to hide it
away as it was hidden in me. Angela is still a closed cocoon,
as if I were not yet born, until I open myself in
metamorphosis, Angela will be mine. When I am strong enough
to be alone and mute — then I will free forever the butterfly
from its cocoon. And even if it lives for only a day, that
butterfly, it is already useful to me: may it flutter its bright
colors above the green brightness of the plants in a garden on
a summer’s morning. When the morning is still early, it looks
just like a light butterfly. Whatever is even lighter than a
butterfly. A butterfly is a petal that flies.
ANGELA: The dancing of the guests.
Ireland, never shalt thou see me. Malta, of Malta, thou art the
prison. A bloody finger points upward. And I remember the
future.
Dutch — is what I am. And I am September too. So many
fruits the lady has. The dog searching for its own tail. Help!
fire! And I am chamber music.
AUTHOR: Angela is a curve in an interminable sinuous spiral. I
am upright, I write triangularly and pyramidally. But whatever is
inside the pyramid — the untouchable, dangerous and inviolable
secret — is Angela. What Angela writes can be read aloud: her
words are voluptuous and give physical pleasure. I am
geometric, Angela is a spiral, all finesse. She is intuitive, I am
logical. She is not afraid to err in the use of words. And I do
not err. I am well aware that she is the succulent grape and I
am the raisin. I am balanced and sensible. She is free of
balance which for her is unnecessary. I am controlled, she
doesn’t repress herself — I suffer more than she does because
I am imprisoned in a narrow cage of forced mental hygiene. I
suffer more because I don’t say why I suffer.
ANGELA: And I am no more than a promise.
But I am a star. I feel that I am a star. Shattered. I am a
shard of glass on the ground.
AUTHOR: This woman is scathing toward herself she is the
sharp points of a star. Those sparkling points wound me too.
You don’t know how to live based on an instant-climax: you
feel it but can’t prolong it into a permanent feeling. You don’t
learn from others, you don’t learn from yourself. I respect you
though you’re not my equal. And am I my equal? I am I?
This question arises from my observation that you don’t seem
to know yourself. You might not know that there is a center
of yourself and that it’s hard as a nut from which your
phosphorescent words radiate.
ANGELA: Seriously: what am I?
No answer.
So I throw my body away. Am I Strauss or just Beethoven?
Do I laugh or cry? I am name. That’s the answer. It’s not
much.
Suddenly I saw myself and saw the world. And I understood:
the world is always someone else’s. Never mine. I am the
pariah of the rich. The poor in soul keep nothing stored away.
The dizziness you feel when in a sudden flash of lightning you
suddenly see the brightness of not understanding. I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND! For fear of madness, I renounced the truth.
My ideas are invented. I don’t take responsibility for them. The
funniest thing is that I never learned how to live. I don’t know
anything. All I know is how to go on living. Like my dog. I’m
afraid of the excellent and the superlative. When something
starts getting really good I either mistrust it or step back. If I
stepped forward I’d be focused on the yellowness of the
splendor that nearly blinds.
AUTHOR: Angela is the vibrating tremor of a tense harp-string
after it’s been plucked: she stays in the air still saying, saying
— until the vibration dies spreading out in froth across the
sands. Afterwards — silence and stars. I know Angela’s body
by heart. I just didn’t understand what she wants. But I gave
her such shape to my life that she seems more real to me
than I do.
ANGELA: My life is a great disaster. It’s a cruel divergence, it’s
an empty house. But there’s a dog inside barking. As for me
— all that’s left for me is to bark at God. I’m going back to
myself. That is where I find a dead destitute girl. But one night
I’ll go to the government archives and set fire to everything
and all the identity cards of the destitute. And only then do I
become so autonomous that I shall only stop writing after I
die. But it’s no use, the blue lake of eternity doesn’t catch fire.
I am the one who would incinerate myself down to my bones.
I shall become number and dust. Let it be. Amen. But I
protest. I protest in vain like a dog in the eternity of the
government archives.
AUTHOR: Angela is a lot like my opposite. To have inside me
the opposite of what I am is in essence indispensible: I won’t
give up my struggle and my indecision and the failure — for
I’m a great failure — failure serves as the foundation of my
existence. If I were a winner? I’d die of boredom. “Getting”
isn’t my strong point. I nourish myself with what’s left over of
me and it’s very little. There is left over however a certain
secret silence.
ANGELA: I only use reason as an anesthetic. But for life I’m a
perennial promise of understanding my submerged world. Now
that there are computers for almost every type of search for
intellectual solutions — I therefore turn back to my rich interior
nothing. And I scream: I feel, I suffer, I am happy, I am
moved. Only my enigma interests me. More than anything, I
search for myself in my great void.
I try to keep myself isolated from the agony of depending on
others, and that agony that seems to them a game of life and
death masks another reality, a truth so extraordinary that they
would keel over in fright were they to face it, as in a scandal.
Meanwhile, they’re studying, working, loving, growing up,
struggling, feeling happy, feeling sad. Life with a capital letter
can give me nothing because I’m going to confess that I too
must have turned down a dead-end alley just like the others.
For I notice in myself, not a pile of facts, and instead strive
almost tragically to be. It’s a question of survival like eating
human flesh when there’s no other food. I struggle not against
people who buy and sell apartments and cars and try to get
married and have children but I struggle with extreme anxiety
for a novelty of spirit. Whenever I feel almost a little illuminated
I see that I am having a novelty of spirit.
My life is a distorted reflection just as the reflection of a face
is distorted in an undulating and unstable lake. Trembling
imprecision. Like what happens to water when you dip your
hand in it. I’m the faintest reflection of erudition. My receptivity
is tuned ceaselessly registering other people’s conceptions,
reflecting in my mirror the subtle shades of distinctions between
the things of life. I who am the result of the true miracle of
the instincts. I am a swampy terrain. In me is born a wet
moss covering slippery rocks. A swamp with its suffocating
intolerably sweet miasmas. A bubbling swamp.
AUTHOR: Trying to possess Angela is like trying desperately to
grab hold of the reflection in the mirror of a rose. Yet all I
had to do was turn away from the mirror and I would have
the rose itself. But then there enters a chilly fear of owning the
strange and delicate reality of a flower.
ANGELA: As a practically permanent contact with logic a
feeling arose in me that I had never felt before: the fear of
living, the fear of breathing. I must struggle urgently because
this fear ties me down more than the fear of death, it is a
crime against myself. I long for my previous atmosphere of
adventure and my stimulating restlessness. I think I still haven’t
fallen into the monotony of living. I recently started suddenly
sighing, deep and prolonged sighs.
AUTHOR: Angela has an invisible diadem atop her thick
hairdo. Sparkling drops of musical notes run down her hair.
ANGELA: I am extremely tactile. Great aspirations are
dangerous, great risk is inherent to great aspirations. Here is a
moment of extravagant beauty: I drink it liquid from the shells
of my hands and almost all of it runs sparkling through my
fingers: but beauty is like that, it is a fraction of a second,
quickness of a flash and then immediately it escapes.
AUTHOR: Since Angela Pralini is a bit unbalanced I would
advise her to avoid the dangerous situations that might break
our fragility. I say nothing to Angela because it’s no use asking
her to avoid recklessness since she was born to be exposed
and go through every kind of experience. Angela suffers a lot
but is redeemed in pain. It’s like giving birth: one must pass
through the sieve of pain in order to be relieved afterwards
seeing before one a new child in the world.
ANGELA: But something broke in me and left me with a
nerve split in two. In the beginning the extremities linked to the
cut hurt me so badly that I paled in pain and perplexity.
However the split places gradually scarred over. Until coldly, I
no longer hurt. I changed, without planning to. I used to look
at you from my inside outward and from the inside of you,
which because of love, I could guess. After the scarring I
started to look at you from the outside in. And also to see
myself from the outside in: I had transformed myself into a
heap of facts and actions whose only root was in the domain
of logic. At first I couldn’t associate me with myself. Where am
I? I wondered. And the one who answered was a stranger
who told me coldly and categorically: you are yourself. Slowly,
as I stopped looking for myself I ended up distracted and
without purpose. I’m good at theorizing. I, who empirically live.
I dialogue with myself: I expose and wonder what was
exposed, I expose and refute, I pose questions to an invisible
audience and they spur me on with their replies. When I look
at myself from the outside in I am the bark of a tree and not
the tree. I didn’t feel pleasure. After I recovered my contact
with myself I impregnated myself and the result was the
agitated birth of a pleasure completely different from what they
call pleasure.
AUTHOR: She experiences the different phases of a fact or a
thought but in the deepest part of her she is extrasituational
and even deeper and more unreachably she exists without
words and is only an unsayable, incommunicable, inexorable
atmosphere. Free of scientific and philosophical rubbish.
ANGELA: I like staircases.
AUTHOR: What charms me about Angela Pralini is her
elusiveness.
ANGELA: The hard wooden rose that I am. But to purify me
there is the pungent myosotis urgently but delicately called
“forget-me-not.”
AUTHOR: I created Angela, but now it’s up to me to create a
new man, as Robinson Crusoe created his solitude on this
earth that is always strange.
ANGELA: As for me, I offer my face to the wind. I look like
I’m bearing news. Joking is one of the most serious things in
the world. And I who imagined making music just for fun.
AUTHOR: Traveling through this book while keeping Angela
company is tricky like going on a journey with the pure yolk
of an egg cupped in the palm of my hand without making it
lose its invisible but real surrounding — invisible, but there’s a
skin made of almost nothing encircling the delicate yolk and
maintaining it without breaking so it can keep being a round
yolk.
Angela is a yolk, but with a small black droplet in its yellow
sun. That means: problem. Besides the problem we have with
living Angela adds another: that of compulsive writing. She
thinks that to stop writing is to stop living. I control her as
much as I can, deleting her merely foolish comments. For
example: she’s dying to write about menstruation just to get it
off her chest, and I won’t let her.
ANGELA: I have such a tendency to be happy. These last few
days I’ve felt radiant and ecstatic about being alive.
AUTHOR: Angela, you’re a frightened thing in an ever-new
world. This very instant will never be repeated until the end of
the centuries.
ANGELA: I’m a privileged being because I’m unique in the
world. I all coiled up with I.
Dodecaphonic music extracts the I. Ah I can’t go on. I who
dance so crazy. Whoever wants me should be the same way.
Bells chime, Orpheus sings. I don’t understand myself and it’s
good. Do you understand me? No, you’re crazy and don’t
understand me.
Bells, bells, bells.
AUTHOR: Angela is someone who steals away from the big
city.
ANGELA: I felt the pulsing of the vein in my neck, I felt the
pulse and the heartbeat and suddenly recognized that I had a
body. For the first time from the matter arose the soul. It was
the first time that I was one. One and grateful. I possessed
myself. The spirit possessed the body, the body throbbed with
spirit. As if outside myself, I looked at me and saw me. I was
a happy woman. So rich that I no longer even needed to live.
I was living for free.
AUTHOR: Angela lives in an atmosphere of the miraculous. No,
there’s no reason to be shocked: the miracle exists: the miracle
is a sensation. Sensation of what? of a miracle. A miracle is a
disposition like the sunflower slowly turning its abundant corolla
toward the sun. The miracle is the final simplicity of existence.
The miracle is the splendid sunflower exploding from its stem,
corolla and roots — and being just a seed. A seed that
contains the future.
ANGELA: I went around sowing.
Between the word and the thought my being exists. My
thought is pure impalpable insaisissable air. My word is made
of earth. My heart is life. My electronic energy is magic of
divine origin. My symbol is love. My hatred is atomic energy.
Everything I just said is worthless, no more than foam.
Anguished.
Hungry and cold and humiliated.
Barefoot I greet you: this is my humility and this nakedness of
feet is my daring.
I don’t want to be only myself. I also want to be what I am
not.
AUTHOR: Is Angela my edge? or am I the edge of Angela? Is
Angela my mistake? Is Angela my variation?
ANGELA: I like myself a little because I’m astringent. And
emollient. And sucupira. And dizzy. Crackling. Not to mention
rather estrogenic. I threw the stick at the cat-cat-cat but the
cat-cat-cat . . . My God, I’m unhappy. Farewell, Day, it’s
already dusk. I’m Sunday’s child.
AUTHOR: Angela is a passion.
ANGELA: I get along better with myself when I’m unhappy: a
coming together takes place. When I’m happy, I feel like
somebody else. Albeit another version of the same. Someone
strangely joyful, whistling, slightly unhappy is more peaceful.
I want so badly to be commonplace and a little vulgar and
say: hope is the last to die.
AUTHOR: I’d like to be able to “cure” her of herself. But her
— “sickness”? is stronger than my powers, her sickness is the
form her life takes.
ANGELA: I am the contemporary of tomorrow.
When I’m alone for a long time, I suddenly don’t recognize
myself and I frighten myself and get chills all over.
From now on I want more than understanding: I want
superunderstanding, I humbly beg that this gift be given me. I
want to understand understanding itself. I want to reach the
most intimate secret of whatever exists. I’m in full communion
with the world.
AUTHOR: Angela lives for the future. It’s as if I didn’t read
today’s papers because there’ll be newer news tomorrow. She
doesn’t live off memories. She, like a lot of people, including
me, is busy making the present moment slide toward the
future moment. She was fifteen when she started to
understand hope.
ANGELA: I see the lamp that is lit. My interior is a mess. But
I light myself up.
AUTHOR: She’s a girl who, while she doesn’t seem to disrupt
the existence of the thought of the present, belongs more to
the future. For her each day has the future of the tomorrow.
Each moment of the day is futurized to the next moment in
nuances, gradations, a gradual increase of subtle characteristics
of sensibility. Sometimes she loses heart, she gets discouraged
when faced with the constant mutability of life. She coexists
with time.
ANGELA: My ideal would be to paint a picture of a picture.
I am so upset that I never perfected what I invented in
painting. Or at least I’ve never heard of this way of painting: it
consists of taking a wooden canvas — Scotch pine is best —
and paying attention to its veins. Suddenly, then a wave of
creativity comes out of the subconscious and you go along with
the veins following them a bit — but maintaining your liberty. I
once did a painting that turned out like this: a robust horse
with a long and extensive blond mane amidst the stalactites of
a grotto. It’s a generic way of painting. And, moreover, you
don’t need to know how to paint: anybody, as long as you’re
not too inhibited, can follow this technique of freedom. And all
mortals have a subconscious. Ah, my God, I have hope
postponed. The future is a past that has not yet come to pass.
Do you ever suddenly find it strange to be yourself?
I’m not a dreamer. I only daydream to attain reality.
AUTHOR: She, who is full of lost opportunities.
Her true countenance is so secret. The almost weightlessness of
a spider’s web. Everything inside her is organized around an
enigma intangible in its most intimate nucleus.
ANGELA: My enormous waste of myself. Even so I’m glutted
and would like to dump even more my treasures hidden in the
ark.
Where’s my current of energy? My sense of discovery: even if
it took an obscure form. I’ve always expected something new
of myself, I was a shiver of expectation: something was always
coming from me or from outside of me.
The thing is I’m endemic.
I can’t stand a particular feeling for long because it leads to
anguish and my mind becomes occupied with that feeling and I
untangle myself from it however I can to regain my freedom
of spirit. I am free to feel. I want to be free to reason. I
aspire to a fusion of body and soul.
I can’t manage to understand on behalf of others. Only in the
disorder of my feelings do I understand for myself and what I
feel is so incomprehensible that I keep quiet and meditate on
the nothing.
AUTHOR: The difference between a liberated imagination and a
libertine imagination — the difference between intimacy and
promiscuity. I (who have as a job to earn money the
profession of judge: innocent or guilty?) try to neutralize the
habit of judging because I can’t stand the divine role of
deciding. I free Angela, I don’t judge her — I let her be.
ANGELA: I just entered myself and frightened already want to
leave. I discover that I am beyond voracity. I’m an impulse
split down the middle.
But once in awhile I go to an impersonal hotel, alone, with
nothing to do, to be naked and without function. Is thinking
having a function?
When I truly think I empty myself.
Alone in the hotel room, I eat the food with brutish and
uncouth satisfaction. For a moment it is true satisfaction —
then it quickly settles in.
And so I go to my castle. I go to my precious solitude. To
retire. I’m all disjointed. But I already start to notice a shine in
the air. A sorcery. My room is a smile. In it there are
stained-glass windows. The colors are cathedral-red,
emerald-green, sun-yellow and deep blue. And my room is that
of a sensual monk.
Here there are evening gales. And sometimes the windows
bang—as in ghost stories.
I’m waiting for rain. When it rains I want it to fall on me,
copiously. I’ll open the window of my room and receive naked
the water of the sky.
Gardens and gardens interspersed with musical chords. A
bloody iridescence. I see my face through the rain. The
stridulating clamor of the piercing wind that sweeps the house
as if it were hollow of furniture and people. It’s raining. I feel
the good summer shower. I have a hut too — sometimes I
won’t stay in the palace, I’ll plunge into my hut. Smelling the
forest. And enjoying the solitude.
The proof that I’m recovering my mental health, is that I get
more permissive with every minute: I allow myself more
freedom and more experiences. And I accept what happens by
chance. I’m anxious for what I have yet to try. Greater psychic
space. I’m happily crazier. And my ignorance grows. The
difference between the insane and the not-insane person is that
the latter doesn’t say or do the things he thinks. Will the police
come for me? Come for me because I exist? prison is payment
for living your life: a beautiful word, organic, unruly, pleonastic,
spermic, durabilic.
Ah, now I know what I am: I am a scribbler. Help me! fire!
fire. Writing can drive a person mad. You must lead a serene
life, well appointed, middle class. If you don’t the madness
comes. It’s dangerous. You must shut your mouth and say
nothing about what you know and what you know is so much,
and is so glorious. I know, for example, God. And I receive
messages from me to myself.
I know how to create silence. It’s like this: I turn on the radio
really loud — then suddenly turn it off. And that’s how I
capture silence. Stellar silence. The silence of the mute moon. It
stops everything: I created silence. In silence you can hear
noises more. Amidst the hammer blows I was hearing the
silence.
I’m afraid of my freedom. My freedom is red! I want them to
put me away. Oh enough with disappointments, I’m so beat
up, the back of my neck hurts, my mouth, my ankles, I was
flogged on my kidneys — what do I want my body for? what
purpose does it serve? just to get beat up? A smack in the
face that is swollen and ruddy. I take refuge in roses, in
words. Little consolation. I’m inflated. I’m worth nothing.
I was interrupted by the silence of the night. The spacious
silence interrupts me, leaves my body in a bundle of intense
and mute attention. I’m on the lookout for nothing. Silence isn’t
the void, it’s the completeness.
I read what I’d written and thought once again: from what
violent chasms is my most intimate intimacy nourished, why
does it deny itself so much and flee to the domain of ideas? I
feel within me a subterranean violence, a violence that only
comes to the surface during the act of writing.
AUTHOR: I don’t write like Angela. Not just because I lack the
ability but because I’m more sober, I don’t spill myself
scandalously. And I only rarely use adjectives.
Angela is a stray dog crossing the deserts of the streets.
Angela, a noble mutt, follows the trail of her owner, who is I.
But she often meanders away and heads off freely wandering
toward nowhere. I leave her in this nowhere, since that’s what
she badly wants. And if she finds hell in life she herself will be
responsible for it all. If she wants to follow me then go ahead
because that way I’ll be in charge and in control. But it’s no
use ordering her around: that frivolous creature who loves
diamonds and pearls escapes me as the unspeakable emphasis
of a dream escapes. Hard to describe Angela: she’s just a
mood, she’s just a way of being, a revealing expression of the
mouth but revealing of what? of something I didn’t know in
her and which now, with no possible description, I barely
know, that’s all. She breathes to me in whispers what she is
and, if I can’t hear her because of my own lack of acuity, I’ll
lose her completely.
If Angela is a potential suicide, as I ended up realizing, do I
make her commit suicide? No. I don’t have the courage: her
life is very precious to me. It’s just that she has a taste for
danger and so do I.
ANGELA: I faint for no reason.
The last time it only took a second. I fall happily into bed and
there’s the void, and then just afterward I was saying to
myself: it was nothing, it’s already over. Hello! Hello! Picasso!
Come see me, as a special favor. I’m a plucked chick.
But what fireworks! Commemorating what? I wonder.
I look at myself from the outside in and see: nothing. My
dog’s worried. There’s something in the air. A transmission of
thoughts. Why don’t people look at me when they speak? They
always look at someone else. I resent it. But God looks me
right in the pupils of my eyes. And I face him. He is my
father-mother-mother-father. And I am they. I think I’ll see
God very soon. It will be The Encounter. For I take risks.
AUTHOR: Angela stirs my fauna and disturbs me. Does her
destiny depend on me? Or was she already pretty much freed
from my breath to the point of continuing herself? When I
think that I could make her die, I tremble all over.
ANGELA: I ask questions out of nervousness. Dismayed. And
ankles? are they very important?
I hear no reply to my question. May God protect my ankles.
And the back of my neck. They are essential places in me.
Writing never worked out for me. Others are intellectuals and I
can hardly pronounce my lovely name: Angela Pralini. An
Angela Pralini? the unhappy one, the one who already suffered
so much. I’m like a foreigner in any part of the world. I am
from the never.
When I was small I twirled, twirled and twirled around until I
got dizzy and fell. I didn’t like falling but the dizziness was
delicious.
I was addicted to getting dizzy. As an adult I twirl but when I
get dizzy I take advantage of that brief moment to fly.
I think that madness is perfection. It’s like perceiving. Seeing is
the pure madness of the body. Lethargy. A tremulous sensibility
making everything around more sensitive and making visible,
with a small and impalpable fright. Sometimes a balanced
imbalance happens like a seesaw that goes up then drops
down. And the imbalance of the seesaw is exactly its balance.
AUTHOR: Angela is organic. She’s not stagnant. And she’s my
impasse. Beyond her I can barely see, beyond her begins
whatever I don’t know how to say.
ANGELA: Today I woke up feeling such nostalgia for
happiness. My whole life I’ve never been free. I always
persecuted myself within me. I became intolerable to myself. I
live in a dilacerating duality. I have an apparent freedom but I
am imprisoned inside me. I wanted an Olympian freedom. But
that freedom is only granted to immaterial beings. As long as I
have a body it will submit me to its demands. I see freedom
as a form of beauty and that beauty is what I lack.
AUTHOR: She is unaware that she’s self-sufficient up to a
point. So she depends on someone who’s got arrhythmia and
never obtains the complete dependence that would be the
surrender of herself, the abandonment of her soul.
ANGELA: My roots are in the earth and from it I arise naked.
Cascade — waterfall.
I want a great heroic panel — upon which I literally
spread-my-self-out. I need grandeur and the smell of grass. I
emerge from my abysses with hands filled with cold emeralds,
transparent topazes and orchidaceous sapphires.
I am a vibrant and crystalline burst of clarinet.
AUTHOR: Even though I try to write what happens to Angela.
There’s no point: Angela is only a meaning. A stray meaning?
She is the words I forgot.
ANGELA: I’m impersonal even in friendship, even in love.
I’m an Anonymous Society. An open parenthesis. Please close
me.
Every being is some other being, undoubtedly one but brittle,
unique fingerprints ad saecula saeculorum.
AUTHOR: She’s always in a situation of at least semi-crisis. She
applies intensity to things that don’t deserve it. To everything
she lends a passion that exceeds the reason for the passion.
And the frivolity is in giving such importance to the foam of
life. Once she’s got something, she no longer desires it.
Grabbing the moment is a synchrony between her and time:
without hurry but without delay. An infinite present that neither
leans toward the past nor projects itself toward the future.
That is why she lives so much. Her life “doesn’t change the
subject,” it’s not interrupted by imaginary life. Imaginary life is
living off the past or for the future. The present brings her
pain. But this highly inexorable present casts a shadow where
she can regain her strength, the warrior’s repose. Emotional
crisis.
She can’t adapt to human beings. As though other beings
existed, besides animals.
ANGELA: Oh sweet animal mystery. Oh gentle joy. So
fascinating. So tremendously fascinating is this challenge of the
beast! Oh sweet martyrdom of not knowing how to speak and
only bark. You’re the one who asks me if dying is sweet. I
don’t know either if dying is sweet. Until now I’ve only known
the death of sleep. I kill myself every night.
Contact with animal life is indispensable to my psychic health.
My dog reinvigorates me completely. Not to mention that he
sometimes sleeps at my feet filling my bedroom with hot humid
life. My dog teaches me to live. All he does is “be.” “Being” is
his activity. And being is my most profound intimacy. When he
falls asleep in my lap I watch over him and his very
rhythmical breathing. And — he motionless in my lap — we
form a single organic being, a living mute statue. That is when
I am moon and I am winds of the night. Sometimes, from so
much mutual life, we trouble one another. My dog is as dog
as a human is human. I love the doggishness and the hot
humanity of both.
The dog is a mysterious animal because he almost thinks, not
to mention that he feels everything except the notion of the
future. The horse, unless he is winged, has his mystery
resolved by nobility and a tiger is slightly more mysterious than
the dog because its manner is even more primitive.
The dog — that misunderstood being who does whatever he
can to share with men what he is . . .
AUTHOR: Angela’s dog seems to have a person inside him.
He is a person trapped by a cruel condition. The dog hungers
so much for people and to be a man. A dog’s inability to
speak is excruciating.
If I could describe the inner life of a dog I would have
reached a summit. Angela too wants to enter the being-alive of
her Ulysses. I was the one who transmitted to her this love of
animals.
ANGELA: Oh God, and here I am competing with myself. I
detest myself. Fortunately others like me, it’s a tranquility. My
dog Ulysses and I are mutts. Ah what a good rain is falling.
It’s manna from heaven and only Ulysses and I know it.
Ulysses drinks ice-cold beer so adorably. One of these days it’s
going to happen: my dog is going to open his mouth and
speak. It’ll be glory. Ulysses is Malta, he’s Amapá — he’s at
the end of the world. How do you get there? He barks square
— I’m not sure you’re getting what I mean. During the world
cup he went mad during the fireworks. And my head got all
square. I try to understand my dog. He’s the only innocent.
I can speak a language that only my dog, the esteemed
Ulysses, my dear sir, understands. Like this: dacoleba, tutiban,
ziticoba, letuban. Joju leba, leba jan? Tutiban leba, lebajan.
Atotoquina, zefiram. Jetobabe? Jetoban. That means something
that not even the emperor of China would understand.
Once he did something unexpected. And I deserved it. I went
to pet him, he growled. And I made the mistake of doing it
again. He gave a sudden leap that rose up from his wild
depths of the wolf and bit my mouth. I was terrified, I had to
go to the emergency room where they gave me sixteen
stitches. They told me to give Ulysses away because he was a
danger. But it so happened that, after the accident, I felt even
closer to him. Perhaps because he made me suffer. Suffering
for a being deepens the heart within the heart.
AUTHOR: Angela and I are my inner dialogue — I talk to
myself. I’m tired of thinking the same thoughts.
ANGELA: It’s so wonderful and comforting to meet someone at
four. Four p.m. is the best time of day. Four p.m. gives you
balance and a calm stability, a serene taste for living. At times
almost a bit whizzing and “in tremolo.” So I become fluttering,
iridescent and slightly excited.
AUTHOR: I must forgive Angela, once again, for this business
about “the best time of the day.” I must excuse her foolishness
because she humbly knows her place: she knows she’s not
one of the elect and she’s certainly not among the chosen. She
knows that she will only be called and chosen once. When
Death decides. Angela would rather it not be so. But, as for
me, I’m already prepared and almost ready to be called. I
realize it because of the disregard I feel for things and even
for the act of writing. I find very little worthwhile now.
ANGELA: I bought a dress of black gauze with scattered
flowers of a dead tone as though there were a veil over them
putting them out. The whole dress seems to be played on a
harp. I can feel myself flying in it, freed from the law of
gravity. I’m ragged and weightless as though from black Africa
I were resurging and arising white and pallid.
Black isn’t a color, it’s the absence of color.
AUTHOR: Angela is losing it. What do I care about the clothes
she bought? She is sometimes an Austrian waltz. And when
she speaks of God she becomes Bach. Moreover, she’s hooked
on possessing. She confuses possessing for living. That’s why a
dress can enrich her soul. Poor soul. She’s vulgar. But she has
one charming quality: she’s a jug from which fresh water
bubbles.
ANGELA: I’m suffering from happy love. That only seems like
a contradiction. When you feel love, you have a deep anxiety.
It’s like I’m laughing and crying at the same time. Not to
mention my fear that this happiness won’t last. I have to be
free — I can’t stand the slavery of great love, love doesn’t
have such a hold on me. I can’t submit to the pressure of the
stronger force.
Where’s my current of energy? my sense of discovery, though
it takes an obscure form? I always expect something new from
me, I am a shiver of expectation — something is always
coming from me or from outside toward me.
AUTHOR: When Angela has a crisis of “womanishness” she
spies on the world through the keyhole of the kitchen door.
Her ambition is to live in a whirlpool of happiness. Stubborn
without believing in life. I wonder if someone could simply
decide: today is going to be an important day in my life. And
then concentrate so much that the sun rises from within one’s
soul and the galaxies swirl slow and mute.
The drama of Angela is the drama of us all: balancing upon
something unstable. For anything can happen and damage the
most intimate life of a person. What will have been done to
my soul next year? Will that soul have grown? and grown
peacefully or through the pain of doubt?
ANGELA: A shot in the middle of the night.
All of a sudden I hear a shot. Or was it a tire that blew out?
Did someone die? What a mystery, dear God. It’s as if they
were shooting me right into my poor heart.
Anyway, what poor thing! My heart is rich and strikes well the
hours of my life.
The patience of the spider spinning the web. Moreover I’m
bothered by badly making things out in the chiaroscuro of
creation. I get skittish with the flash of inspiration. I am pure
fear.
AUTHOR: I’d like to expose Angela to some terrifying music.
The music would have intervals of terrible silence with drops of
flute-song here and there. Then a contralto voice suddenly and
with extreme softness would hum with a closed mouth
excessively calm and sure of itself: as in the threat that is
made when one is sure of possessing deadly weapons. Angela
would run and hide beneath the covers, holding on tightly to
her dog Ulysses. I’m a little jealous of Ulysses. He’s so
important to Angela. And she doesn’t seem grateful to me for
having invented her. So I’ll avenge myself with that terrifying
music: a single note but repeated, repeated, repeated until
near-madness. Angela fears madness and already thinks she’s
strange. I too find myself a bit strange but I don’t fear
madness: I venture an icy lucidity. I see everything, I hear
everything, I feel everything. And I stay far away from the
intellectualized environments that would confound me. I am
alone in the world. Angela is my only companion. You must
understand me: I had to invent a being that was entirely mine.
But it so happens that she’s becoming too powerful.
ANGELA: I rarely scream. When I do scream it is a red and
emerald scream. But in general I whisper. I speak quietly to tell
timidly. Telling is very important. Telling the truth that covers
itself in lies. How often I lie, my God. But it’s to save myself.
A lie is also a truth, it’s just cunning and a little nervous. Lie
if you can, and may you lie with a peaceful spirit. Because the
truth demands a long staircase to climb as if I were
condemned never to stop. I’m tired: that’s also why I speak
softly — it’s so I don’t offend myself.
AUTHOR: I’m an entangled and lost writer. Writing is difficult
because it touches the boundaries of the impossible.
My head is full of characters but only Angela occupies my
mental space.
ANGELA: It was intensely cold without any possible shelter.
And the driver of the yellow cab had a bad cold. I forgot to
say that, when I jumped out of the first taxi, in the middle of
Avenida Rio Branco, people were crying out to me: I looked
and saw everything that belonged to me exposed without blood
on the asphalt of the street. And people were helping me in
the middle of the traffic to gather my secrets. Because my
purse had opened and been disemboweled: its entrails and my
trampled prayers scattered across the ground. I gathered
everything and stood humble and dignified waiting for who
knows what. And while I was waiting a thin woman appeared
and said, startling me: pardon me for asking, ma’am, but
where did you buy that lovely green shawl? I was dismayed,
and said to her defeated: I don’t remember. Small unusual
facts were happening to me, and I at their mercy.
AUTHOR: Angela is always becoming. Angela is my adventure.
For that matter I am my own great adventure: I risk myself
every instant. But there is a greater adventure: the God, I
won’t risk it.
ANGELA: I kept wandering aimlessly through the city. In the
square the ones who give crumbs to the pigeons are the
prostitutes and bums — more children of God than I. I give
crumbs to you, my love. I, prostitute and bum. But with
honor, folks, with my tribute to the pigeons. What a desire to
do something wrong. The error is exciting. I’m going to sin.
I’m going to confess something: sometimes, just for fun, I lie.
I’m not at all what you think I am. But I respect the truth:
I’m pure of sins.
Organ music is demonic. I want my life to be accompanied, as
with twin sisters, by organ music. But it frightens me. Funeral
music? I’m not sure, I’m a little out of it.
Today I killed a mosquito. With the most brutal sort of tact.
Why? Why kill something that lives? I feel like a murderer and
a guilty person. And I’ll never forget that mosquito. Whose
destiny I traced. The great killer. I, like an industrial crane,
dealing with a delicate atom. Forgive me, little mosquito, forgive
me, I’ll never do it again. I think we have to do forbidden
things — otherwise we suffocate. But without feeling guilty and
instead as an announcement that we are free.
I’m my own mirror. And I live off the lost and found. That’s
what saves me. I’m caught in an invisible war between
dangers. Who will win? I always lose.
AUTHOR: Angela is very provisional.
ANGELA: I can’t manage to comprehend myself, no.
It’s smoke in my eyes, it’s the busy signal, it’s the broken
fingernail, scratch of chalk on the blackboard, it’s the stuffy
nose, it’s suddenly rotten fruit, it’s a speck in the eye, it’s a
kick in the butt, it’s a stomp on the corn on my foot, it’s a
needle piercing my tender finger, it’s a shot of Novocain, it’s
spit in my face.
I am a perfect actress.
AUTHOR: Crazy gazelle that she is.
ANGELA: My most intimate friend? A typewriter. There’s a
pleasant taste in my mouth when I think.
AUTHOR: She’s a substantial beast.
I want your truth Angela! Just that: your truth that I can’t
quite grasp.
ANGELA: I love my feet: they obey me. And without doubting.
The basic reason for my life is that there comes a time when
I’m guided by a great hunger. That explains me. I’m indirect.
I’m a person who is sudden and I get a little desperate when
I think about the impossible. For example: I’ll never manage to
get a phone call from the emperor of Japan. I could be dying
and he wouldn’t call me. Or: how do you locate someone who
isn’t home? The impossible subdues me. I wither. Only last
Sunday night — alone with my dog — my body joined my
body. And then I was. I was I.
I’m hungry and sad. It’s good to be a little sad. It’s a sweet
feeling. And it’s good to be hungry and eat.
The most beautiful music in the world is the interstellar silence.
I’m sorry, but I can’t be alone with you or else a star will be
born in the air. Those who love solitude do not love freedom.
Flowers? flowers give such a fright. The perfect silence of a
flower. Soft like turning off the light to go to sleep. And the
light switch makes a little noise that seems to say: good night
my love.
Ah, I’m filled with desire! I want to eat salmon and drink
coffee. And cake. Everything’s no more than a grand comedy
that looks like a kermis. I want to be part of the festival of
animals. In the shadows the rustling garden. The
garden-abettor. Hiding-place of sparrows. Secrecy. The garden
played on the harp . . . Creative intumescence.
I was alone for a whole Sunday. I didn’t call anyone and no
one called me. I was completely alone. I sat on my sofa with
my mind free. But as the day went on toward bedtime I
experienced about three times a sudden recognition of myself
and of the world that spooked me and made me plunge into
obscure depths which I departed for golden light. It was the
encounter of the I with the I. Solitude is a luxury.
AUTHOR: I looked for you in dictionaries and couldn’t find
your meaning. Where is your synonym in the world? where is
my own synonym in life? I’m unequalled.
ANGELA: In some modern music a precise note of heroic
classicism is missing.
AUTHOR: You’re missing a certain extravagance, you don’t
have a way of treating others more generously. You are the
literal meaning.
ANGELA: I thought of something so beautiful that I couldn’t
even understand it. And I ended up forgetting what it was.
AUTHOR: I love you geometrically and at a point on the
horizon forming a triangle with you. The result is a perfume of
macerated roses.
ANGELA: Pain? Happiness? It’s simply a matter of opinion.
I divine things that have no name and perhaps never shall.
Yes. I sense things that will always be inaccessible to me. Yes.
But I know everything. All that I know without exactly knowing
it has no synonym in the world of speech but enriches me
and justifies me. Although I lost the word because I tried to
speak it. And knowing-everything-without-knowing is a perpetual
forgetting that comes and goes like the waves of the sea that
advance and recede on the sands of the beach. To civilize my
life is to expel me from myself. To civilize my deepest existence
would be to try to expel my nature and supernature. All of
this meanwhile does not address my possible meaning.
What kills me is the day-to-day. I only wanted exceptions. I’m
lost: I have no habits.
AUTHOR: Angela has all this fairy-like illumination — and while
she grows accustomed slow and mute and majestic and
extremely delicate and fatal — to being a woman — she’s too
modest for it, too fleeting to be defined. She told me that once
on the street she approached an officer — and explained that
she did so because he should know about things and to top it
off was armed, which filled her with respect. So she said to the
officer: sir, could you tell me, if you please, when does
springtime begin?
Angela is mad. But she has a mathematical logic in her
apparent madness. And she has a lot of fun, that scandalous
creature. She gets too keen and then doesn’t know what to do
with herself. To hell with her. Between the “yes” and the “no”
there is only one way: choosing. Angela chose “yes.” She is so
free that one day she’ll end up in jail. “In jail for what?” “For
excessive freedom.” “But isn’t that freedom innocent?” “Yes.
Even naive.” “So why prison?” “Because freedom offends.”
I wanted to defend Angela with strong Swiss military guards, so
sinful is she, so much does she squander her life. Yet she’s
happy as a military march.
ANGELA: I am an “actress,” I appear, say what I know then
exit the stage. What more could such a rich person want who
has a highly intelligent mechanism like a supercomputer?
AUTHOR: I’m worrying too much about Angela’s life and
forgetting my own. I became am abstraction of myself: I’m a
sign, I symbolize something that exists more than I do, I’m in
the category of things that can’t be categorized.
ANGELA: Presence of princes, Amazons, Vikings, Atlantises,
sprites, fauns, gnomes, mothers, prostitutes, giants, all with lips
painted black and green nails. Roots tangled and angled,
exposed, immobilization by the pain of having grown.
AUTHOR: She sometimes sees reality, a reality more invented
and that never comes close to the truth, as if that entirely
naked truth would frighten her. She is a superlative. She
pretends she’s happy, but sometimes that happiness disturbs
her.
ANGELA: I come from a long longing. I, who am praised and
adored. But nobody wants anything to do with me. My
irrepressible spirit frightens anyone who might come along. With
a few exceptions, everyone’s scared of me as though I might
bite. Neither I nor Ulysses bites. We’re gentle and happy, and
sometimes we bark in anger or fear. I hide my failure from
myself. I give up. And sadly I collect expressions of love. In
Portuguese it’s “eu te amo.” In French — “je t’aime.” In
English — “I love you.” In Italian — “io t’amo.” In Spanish —
“yo te quiero.” In German — “Ich liebe disch,” is that right?
Me of all people, the unloved. The most disappointed one of
all, she who every night tastes the sweetness of death.
I feel like a charlatan. Why? It’s as if I weren’t revealing my
final truth. So I have to take off my clothes and be naked in
the street. That’s not so hard. But what’s hard is to have a
naked soul. So I give myself to God. And I pray a lot that
protection might be granted me. Am I from another planet?
what am I? the humblest of the humble who is prostrate on
the ground and presses her half-open mouth to the earth in
order to suck its blood. Oh earth, but what a scent of wet
grass. How comforting it is. And I also undress in the sea.
Could it be I’ll have a tragic end? Oh please spare me. Please:
because I am fragile. What awaits me when I die? I already
know: when I die I’ll go transparent as jade.
AUTHOR: Angela is afraid to travel for fear of losing her I
during the trip. She needs for at least one minute in her life
to catch herself in the act. To catch what’s living and take her
immobile picture and look at herself in the picture and think
that the snapshot left a proof, that of the already-dead picture.
ANGELA: Suddenly an odd feeling. I find myself odd as
though a movie camera were filming my steps and suddenly
stopped, leaving me immobile in the middle of a gesture:
caught in the act. Me? Am I the one who is I? But this is a
mad senselessness! Part of me is mechanical and automatic —
neurovegetative, the balance between not wanting and wanting,
of not being able and being able, all of it sliding along in the
routine of mechanism. The camera singled out the instant. And
so it is that I automatically left myself in order to capture
myself dazed by my own enigma, right there before me, which
is unprecedented and terrifying because it’s extremely true,
profoundly naked life merged into my identity. And this
encounter between life and my identity forms a miniscule
unbreakable and radiant indivisible diamond, a single atom and
all of me feels my body go numb as when you stay in the
same position for a long time and your leg suddenly “falls
asleep.”
I am too nostalgic, I seem to have lost something who knows
where or when.
AUTHOR: I shall write here toward the air and responding to
nothing because I am free. I — I who exist. There’s a
voluptuousness in being someone. I am no longer silence. I feel
so impotent while living — life that sums up all the disparate
and dissonant opposites in a single and ferocious stance: rage.
I finally reached the nothing. And in my satisfaction at having
reached in myself the minimum of existence, only the necessary
breathing — I am therefore free. All that’s left for me is to
invent. But I immediately warn myself: I’m uncomfortable.
Uncomfortable for myself. I feel ill at ease in this body that is
my baggage. But that discomfort is the first step toward my —
toward my what? truth? As if I had the truth?
I say nothing like real music does. It doesn’t speak words. I
feel no longing for myself — what I was no longer interests
me! And if I should speak, may I allow myself to be
discontinuous: I have no obligation to myself. I go on
accumulating myself, accumulating myself, accumulating myself —
until I no longer fit within me and burst into words.
When I write, I mix one color with another, and a new color
is born.
I want to forget that I never forgot. I want to forget the praise
and the jeers. I want to re-inaugurate myself. And for that I’ll
have to renounce my whole body of work and begin humbly,
without deificaton, from a beginning in which there are no
traces of any habit, foibles or abilities. I’ll have to put aside my
know-how. For that reason I expose myself to a new kind of
fiction, which I still don’t even know how to handle.
The main thing I want to reach is to surprise myself with what
I write. To be assaulted: to tremble before what was never
said by me. To fly low in order not to forget the ground. To
fly high and wildly in order to let loose my great wings. Up
until now I feel like I’ve never really taken flight. This book, I
suspect, won’t let me fly either despite my desire to. Because
nothing will be decided in this matter, in this matter all that
counts is what happens when it comes from the nothing. But
the worst thing is that the thought in the word has already
been spent. Each loose word is a thought stuck to it like flesh
to a nail.
ANGELA: I am what’s beyond thought. I write in the state of
drowsiness, only a slight contact with what I’m living within
myself and also an inter-relational life. I act like a sleepwalker.
The next day I don’t recognize what I wrote. I only recognize
my own handwriting. And I find a certain charm in the
freedom of phrases, not worrying much about an apparent
disconnection. Phrases have no interference from time. They
could happen in the next century just as they could have
happened in the last, with small superficial variations.
Could my individuality be dead?
AUTHOR: Everything goes by in a daydream: real life is a
dream. I don’t need to “understand” myself. That I can vaguely
feel, is enough for me. When I think without any thought — I
call that meditation. And it’s so profound that I can’t quite
reach and words disappear, manifestations. I meditate, and
what emerges from that meditation has nothing to do with
meditation: an idea comes that seems totally disconnected from
the meditation. It seems it’s only useful to live interrogatively
since every interrogation tossed into the air has a
corresponding reply formed in the darkness of my being, that
part of me which is dark and vital, without it I’d be empty.
Whenever I do something deliberately nothing comes out,
therefore I get distracted almost deliberately. I pretend I don’t
want something, I end up believing I don’t want it and only
then does the thing come.
Things happen indirectly. They come sideways. I’d swear it’s
from the left side. (I get on better with my left side.) Which is
battered like a look of sensitive melancholic tenderness. It’s the
encounter between purity and purity and so we feel we’re
allowed it, I don’t know what else to say. So — I don’t say it
or maybe it would be better for me to say it. To be a being
allowed to yourself is the glory of existing. To be able to say to
yourself with shame and awkwardly: it’s you, too, you I love, a
bit. I allow myself. Then I reach the ultra-sonorous. The one
speaking, it seems to be me, but I’m not. It’s a “she” that
speaks in me.
Sometimes I’m dense like Beethoven, other times I’m Debussy,
strange and light melody. All accompanied by a breathing, three
movements and pouring out from four wonders. My dream is
accompanied by a breathing and by three instants from which
seven wonders pour. I walk atop and along the sound of a
single prolonged note. The translucent green morning with the
chirping of hundreds of little birds still has something of the
dark night’s nightmare: a dog barks in the harsh morning off
in the distance.
As I was saying: it was God who invented me. And so too do
I — as in the Greek Olympiads the athletes who ran passed
forward the burning torch — so too do I use my breath and
invent Angela Pralini and make her a woman. A beautiful
woman.
Angela and I are my interior dialogue: I talk to myself. Angela
is from my dark interior: she however comes to light. The
tenebrous darkness from which I emerge. Pullulating darkness,
lava of a humid volcano burning intensely. Darkness full of
worms and butterflies, rats and stars.
I think in hieroglyphs (mine). And in order to live I must
constantly interpret myself and each time the key to the
hieroglyph, I’m sure that the dream — thing (mine) (worthless),
not carried through — is the key to the same.
I write in words that hide others — the true ones. Because the
true words cannot be named. Even if I don’t know which are
the “true words,” I am always alluding to them. My spectacular
and ongoing failure proves that the opposite exists: success.
Even if success is not granted me, I’m satisfied to know it
exists.
Occasionally I myself am writing this book.
So I’ll talk about the problems of writing. About the vortex
which is placing oneself in a creative state. I feel that I have a
triple star.
I, the author of this book, am being possessed by a thousand
demons writing inside me. This need to flow, ah, never, never
to stop flowing. If that source that exists within each of us
stops it’s horrible. The source is of mysteries, hidden mysteries
and if it stops that is because death is coming. I’m trying in
this book a bit crazy, a bit ostentatious, a bit dancing naked in
the streets, a bit the clown, a bit the fool at the court of the
king. I, the king of sleep, I only know how to sleep and eat, I
learned nothing else. As for the rest, ladies and gentlemen, I
hold my tongue. I just won’t tell you the secret of life because
I still haven’t learned it. But one day I shall be the secret of
life. Each of us is the secret of life and the one is the other
and the other is the one.
I must not forget the Franciscan modesty of the sweetness of
a little bird. Speak marvelous things ah ye who wish to write
life long or short as it may be. It is a cursed profession that
gives no rest. I don’t know if it’s the dream that makes me
write or if the dream is the result of a dream that comes from
writing. Are we full or hollow? Who art thou who readest me?
Art thou my secret or am I thy secret?
With a poor life (and what is a rich life?), with life poor I
escape from it through the imaginary. But my imaginary
doesn’t happen through actions but through the feeling-thinking
that is actually a dream. I imagine marvelous words and I
receive from them their dazzle. The word “topaz” transports
me to the deepest part of my dream: topaz fascinates me in
its luminous abyss of real stone. Once I dreamed there was a
reality: it happened when I pondered the mute enigma of the
dreamt reality that exists in topaz.
In the act of writing I attain here and now the most secret
dream, the one I can’t remember when I wake up. In what I
write the only thing that interests me is finding my timbre. My
timbre of life.
I love Angela Pralini because she allows me to sleep while she
speaks. I who sleep for a certain preparative experience of
death. A beginner’s course because death is so
incommensurable that I shall be lost within it. No — to speak
sincerely — I can’t allow the world to exist after my death. My
regrets to those I leave behind alive and watching television,
regrets because humanity and the human condition are guilty
without absolution for my death.
ANGELA: At night the dead walk the paths of the old
cemetery and no one hears their cymbals. A clarinet goes out
of tune sharp and mute. I tremble in my bed with a chill that
shakes me and doesn’t. I don’t scream. No. But I am barely
alive. I’m nothing but a stifled breath. I think low and
slow-moving: if I am alive it’s because I shall die. The clarinet
plays again. And now I’m going to turn out the light and
sleep.
AUTHOR: (While Angela sleeps.) All the words written here
can be summed up by an ever-present state I call “I am
being.”
ANGELA: Not long ago I saw a slice of watermelon on the
table. And, there on the naked table, it looked like a madman’s
laugh (I don’t know how else to put it). If I weren’t resigned
to living in a world that forces me to be sensible, how I would
scream in fright at the happy prehistoric monstrosities of the
earth. Only an infant isn’t shocked: he too is a happy
monstrosity repeated since the beginning of the history of man.
Only afterwards does fear come, the pacification of fear, the
denial of fear — in a word, civilization. Meanwhile, atop the
naked table, the screaming slice of red watermelon. I am
grateful to my eyes that are still so frightened. I shall yet see
many things. To be honest, even without watermelon, a naked
table is also a sight to see.
AUTHOR: I write as if I were sleeping and dreaming: phrases
disconnected as in a dream. It’s difficult, being awake, to
dream freely about my remote mysteries. There is a coherence
— but only in the depths. For someone on the surface and
not dreaming the phrases mean nothing. Although even awake
some know they are living in a dream within real life. What is
real life? the facts? no, real life is only reached through that
part of real life that’s dreamt.
Dreaming is not an illusion. But it is the act that a person
does alone.
I — I want to break the limits of the human race and become
free to the point of the wild or “divine” cry.
But I feel defenseless before the world that is then open to
me. Who? who will accompany me in this solitude whose
summit I, if it weren’t for you, Angela, would never reach? Or
perhaps I’m wanting to enter the most remote mysteries that
while I’m asleep only emerge in dreams.
Imagination precedes reality! Except I only know how to
imagine words. I only know one thing: I am pungently real.
And that I am alive photographing the dream. Anyone can
daydream as long you don’t keep your consciousness too
brightly lit.
My life is attempting to conquer that Unknown. Because God is
from another world — the great ghost.
Real life is a dream, but with open eyes (that see everything
distorted). Real life enters us in slow motion, including the most
rigorous rationality — it’s a dream. Consciousness is only useful
to me for knowing that I live fumbling around and in the (only
apparent) illogic of the dream. The dream of the wakeful is
real matter. We are such illogical dreamers that we count on
the future. I base my life upon the waking dream. What guides
me is the project by which tomorrow comes to be tomorrow.
My freedom? my own freedom is not free: it runs on invisible
rails. Not even madness is free. But it’s also true that freedom
without a directive would be a butterfly flying in the air. But in
the dreams of the wakeful there’s an inconsequential lightness
of a brook, bubbling and coherent. The state of being.
What I dream at night and forget the next morning — that
intimate discomfort of someone who ignores part of his life:
death escapes me. Sometimes I don’t sleep all night hoping to
dream while I’m awake and to be conscious of the mystery
and depths of the dream. And actually, even without sleeping,
out of fatigue, I start to daydream.
I am an abyss of myself. But I shall always be aslant. And the
white horses fill my pupils with burning love. I own seven
purebred horses. Six white and one black.
Daily life contains within itself the abuse of daily life: daily life
has the tragedy of the tedium of repetition. But there’s a
loophole: that the great reality is exceptional, like a dream in
the entrails of the day.
I’ve never had a vocation for writing: the number is what
fascinated me since I was a boy. If now I daily and clumsily
make notes, it’s because my wife’s no good at conversation.
I used to try to write and thought it was fun, it’s an
adventure, I never know what will happen to me in the form
of words and what I’ll discover from day to day for my own
good, I’ll do everything possible not to use the technical
vocabulary that comes to me naturally because I studied
physics.
ANGELA (
Depth: somnambulism): Good morning and good
afternoon and good night for whenever you like, oh charging
rhinoceros and I must be careful with you. I’ll say it like this:
careful-careful-careful. Careful with the high sky, it can come
down and entangle me in mists and blue and my wings will fly
in blind flight up into those dense mists of the blue that is not
transparent because the blue of the sky is not transparent and
in it are encrusted the stars, but the sun and the moon are in
front of the blue, the blue is behind the sun and the moon,
and the sun and the moon swim above in the air without
color. What separates me from the blue of the high sky are
the absolute kilometers of air without color and the air without
color is round and is what I breathe, I don’t breathe the blue
sky. And when you put your cold hand in mine, I, the warm
one, feel a shiver down my spine and I kill, kill, kill you until
you are completely dead and of no use to any other woman,
again I kill, kill and kill you. I don’t want you at all, “mister”
cold-hand. I’ll go off in search of a warm hand, and send you
my true love back to the bitch that bore you, there’s a
disturbing gap between us — that’s why I’m thinking of filling
this gap and I have a lover to favor you and save you from
the empty and hollow bottomless gap that is the void. What
I’m writing now is meant for no one: it’s directly meant for
writing itself, this writing consumes writing. This, my book of
the night, nourishes me with a cantabile melody. What I write
is autonomously real.
I want the thinking-feeling now and, no, to have it only had
yesterday or going to have it tomorrow. I’m in a certain hurry
to feel everything. I don’t want anything to get lost in the
passage from the I-mine to the I-global. I want to reach within
myself a landscape deep beneath the earth a spring of placid
waters running — and my ecstatic soul that can’t be restrained
and trembles in the lightest orgasm. Pure contemplation.
I never saw anything more solitary than having a new and
original idea. Not if you’re supported by no one and barely
believe in yourself. The newer the sensation-idea, the closer you
seem to the solitude of madness. When I have a new
sensation it thinks I’m strange and I think it’s strange. I also
can’t stand the piercing and lonely happiness of feeling happy. I
lack the serenity to accept good news. When I get happy, I
become nervous and agitated. The light shimmers too brightly
for my poor eyes.
AUTHOR: As a profession I wanted to be the one who rings
the bells (but not to call the faithful). With what joy I myself
would tremble at the translucent, potent and echoing vibrations
in the air of life: vigorous ecstatic tolling. It is a sound even
more splendid than Bach.
But my kingdom is not the clamorous transparency of the soul
of the bells. To the contrary: tenebrous I feed off the black
bitter roots of the trees, reaching them by digging into the
earth with knotty hard fingers and dirty nails: I eat and chew
and swallow the earth.
What am I saying! It is or isn’t the truth. I lie so much that I
write. I lie so much that I live. I lie so much that I seek the
truth of me. You will be my truth. I want the truthful seed of
you. If I manage to cross the dense forest of deceptions. I’m a
blunder in a labyrinth made of the bloody threads of nerves.
And I don’t understand what you’re saying, Angela, I only
understand what you’re thinking. Wanting to understand is one
of the worst things that could happen to me. But through your
innocence I am learning not to know. But I live in danger. Not
the danger of facts but something more urgent . . .
ANGELA (
Somnambulism): Dark gray your eyes of steel that
fascinate me your mouth of edges lighter than your lips. You
only embrace me too strongly when you want to but never
guess when I want to.
Grapes, a bunch of grapes round and fleshy and liquid and
falsely transparent because they give the impression of being
transparent, but you can’t see the other side you are entirely
opaque though you give the impression of transparency what
the hell do I have to do with the opacity of things and yours
the bull on the ranch is stocky the cows smelling of pastures
and unheard-of pastures the pasture lies in the open air
between pasture and sky I breathe the air that flies flies lightly
when it starts to blow gently against my naked and
uncontrolled crazy face when the windows bang and bang the
gusts of winds I really like being touched by the wind as I like
to expose myself to the gusts that bang against the doors and
windows of the entire house. They bang and bang fast crazy
we and the servants run to shut them and inside the shut
mansion we suffocate in dying electric light listening to the
whine of the violent and quick wind the shut doors and
windows shake.
It’s said like this kissed by the cliché breeze I prefer to say
that the breeze blesses me between slightly ochre and at the
same time lightly astringent it’s also lightly sweet on lips that
are polluted by the pollen brought by the veil of perfume that
is the breeze.
AUTHOR: Angela, who knows why she had this idea: to count
numbers from one to a thousand. And something in fact
happens: as the numbers go higher, she herself reaches a state
of extreme grace, so rarefied it’s almost unbreathable. It
happens like a somnambulist hypnosis but with a slight touch
of consciousness: just enough for her to be aware of herself.
And to know she’s being carried off by her own self — all of
a sudden, a stranger — to a realm full of fables.
Angela is a dream of mine.
I’m sleepy-headed and the words flow out of me coming from
a flux that is not mental. Empty the way you get when you
reach the purest state of thinking. To sprout into thought is
very exciting, sensual. Though sometimes sultry weather, sun
behind the clouds. As for me, I keep my strange power a
secret. I’m not sure what kind of power — part darkness and
perhaps of some strength. Who knows if that power is
summed up in breathing? in thinking? in almost foreseeing? in
being able to kill and not killing? It’s a contained power.
Sometimes the thought that springs up tickles me because it’s
so light and inexpressible. I have thoughts I cannot translate
into words — sometimes I think a triangle. But when I try to
think I get worried about trying to think and nothing comes
up. Sometimes my thought is only the whispering of my leaves
and branches. But for my best thought words are not found.
I discovered that I need to not know what I’m thinking — if I
become conscious of what I’m thinking, I can no longer think,
I can only see myself think. When I say “think” I’m referring
to the way I dream words. But thought needs to be a feeling.
I now know how to think of nothing. It was a conquest. Not
thinking means the inexpressible contact with the Nothing. The
“Nothing” is the beginning of a free availability that Angela
would call Grace.
ANGELA: I had insomnia last night.
I closed my eyes relaxed my body and tried not to think so I
could fall asleep. Little by little I started having a strange
awareness of abandonment. My (thought?) my essence was . .
. My body was beside me and I saw it transparent and
through the transparency pulsing arteries, living, full of blood
that circulated as quickly as possible through all of my limbs:
they looked like irrigation channels. I also saw air, water and a
yellow liquid. I could see everything in full color. Everything in
absolute silence. Not everyone is given the fleeting plunge into
one’s own mysterious flesh. This body of mine that is
autonomous and surely electronic. No machine makes me live.
My body is alive and works like a factory working in absolute
silence. My interior is one of the strangest and most beautiful
things in the world. I am brilliant Nature. Only God, who is
creative energy, could have made me with the perfection of the
treasure that I have inside me. Afterwards my thought or
visionary essence returned to me and that return was very
comfortable and I felt fully satisfied. And with a delicate
tenderness for possessing that inexplicable thing that worked for
me. I don’t remember anything else. Right afterwards I felt a
drowsiness slowly taking me over and I fell asleep beneath the
blessing of the body of God.
AUTHOR: Angela thinks that the state of grace or of life lies in
making the most of oneself in the external world. She even
strives to conquer God, making Him the external world. But
the one who lives in a state of grace, not permanently but with
great frequency, is me. I managed this through a disinterest in
the world. I live an emptiness that is also called fullness. Not
having heaps blessings upon me. As for my practical life I
managed to live in a big and turbulent city as if it were
provincial and easy.
Angela writes the way she lives: projecting herself. But I am
already free: I write for nothing. I clear a path for myself. I
live without models. I write without models. Being free is what
gives me that great responsibility.
I . . . I . . . I?
ANGELA: As for me, I’m cautious but I’m not stupid. Tonight
— blustery — I dreamt such a gratifying dream. There was a
boy of 14 and a girl of 13 who were running after one
another, hiding behind trees, and bursting out laughing, playing.
And suddenly they stopped and mute, serious, frightened
looked into one another’s eyes: because they knew one day
they would love.
AUTHOR: Angela is urgent and emergent. As a judge I am
unfortunately more tied to the slow than I’d wish.
Here I am. I was enlisted and I introduce myself to myself.
And a drop of gold falls. Reality is more unattainable than God
— because you cannot pray to reality.
In the dream of the real it seems it’s not me I’m living but
somebody else. That other person is Angela who is my
daydream.
Am I speaking or is Angela speaking?
Reality does not exist in itself. What there is is seeing the truth
through the dream. Real life is merely symbolic: it refers to
something else.
Action — that is the aim of the sorcerer! The sorcerer tries to
substitute himself for the Law, either for his own benefit, or for
the benefit of the person who employs and pays him.
I wouldn’t exist if there were no words.
Angela goes from language to existence. She wouldn’t exist if
there were no words.
I’ve been a writer a long time, and I can only say that the
more you write the harder it gets. Am I competing against
myself? For example, I’ve been wanting to write about a
person I invented: a woman named Angela Pralini. And it’s
difficult. How to separate her from me? How do I make her
different from what I am? One thing’s for sure and it’s no use
trying to change it: Angela inherited from me the desire to
write and to paint. And if she inherited that part of me, it’s
because I can’t imagine a life without the art of writing or
painting or making music. What does Angela want from life?
Little by little I’ll find out. At the same time I’ll find out what I
want from life. It’s just that Angela is propelled by ambition
and I by a chaste humility. To write I can’t lose sight of my
paltry ability. I am a low musical note. Angela is a high note,
she’s a cry in the air. I whisper, Angela, with a clear, high and
limpid voice, sings her futilities that have the gift of looking like
profound and fantastic realities. I lost my style: which I
consider a gain: the less style I have, the purer the naked
word that emerges. I must, in my solitude, confide in someone
and that’s why I made Angela be born: I want to maintain a
dialogue with her. But it so happens that, in pages predating
these, in written pages I already tore up, I stated that my
dialogue with Angela is a dialogue of the deaf: one of us says
something and the other says yes but in response to something
else, and then I come along saying no, and I see Angela’s not
even contradicting me. Each of us follows a different thread in
the plot, without really hearing the other very much. That is
freedom. And I can’t complain: I myself gave Angela this
freedom and independence. She almost always ignores me. I
fight to maintain my style whatever that is and of which the
critics have not yet purified me. — Angela fights to create her
own way of expressing herself. So, because in a certain sense I
am her owner — I force her to write simply. Angela — how
can I explain — has a golden anxiety. I have the weight of an
anguish in my chest, anguish without gold or crystal or silver.
Angela is sun-gold, she’s glittering-diamond, she’s reflecting
crystal. I also imagine her like an enormous emerald sparkling
in the void of the air and her deep transparent green is
magical. She is a waterfall of precious stones. I envy her, I
who variably lose my opacity.
ANGELA: I came up against the impossible of myself.
At that point, I went off key without meaning to. Unreal like
music. I, sleepy and phantasmagoric in deepest night filled with
smoke and we surrounding the bright yellowish lamp, light that
will not let me sleep, like the intense spotlights that torturers
shine on their victims to not let them rest.
I used to be a woman who knew how to make things out
when I saw them. But now I committed the grave error of
thinking.
AUTHOR: Angela lives stunned in great disorder. If not for me,
Angela wouldn’t be conscious. If not for me, she’d be
diaphanous like the perfume of a dream. For her to be more
than the perfume of a dream I scatter across her vastness a
hard cactus here, some more over there. Like milestones.
Perfume of a dream? but she’s the immaterial substratum of
me.
ANGELA: I’m like a sleepwalker. I want to compose a
symphony whose scenario includes silence — and the audience
wouldn’t clap because they would sense that the motionless
musicians — as in a photograph — didn’t mean to say “the
end.” The music is at its peak — then there’s a minute of
silence — and the sounds start again.
AUTHOR: Besides my involuntary but incisive role of poor
scribbler — besides that is the silence that invades all the
interstices of my total darkness.
Music deeply teaches me a boldness in the world to feel itself.
I seek disorder, I seek the primitive state of chaos. That is
where I feel myself living. I need the darkness that implores,
the receptivity of the most primary forms of wanting.
The small success of my books made it hard for me to write.
I was invaded by the words of others. I must reencounter my
difficulty. It comes from what is true in me. I must free myself
of skills. These skills allow me to write even for the
semi-literate. For I don’t even need myself. I’m free of myself.
Terribly idle because I need nothing else. Not even the next
day.
What sustains and balances a man are his little hang-ups and
habits. And they enhance his development because whatever is
repeated often enough ends up deepening a demeanor and
allowing it space. But in order to experience any sort of
surprise the routine of habits and hang-ups must be for
whatever reason suspended. What am I left with? With critical
depth or a stimulating surprise? I believe I’m left with both,
anarchically intermingled or simultaneous. Simultaneity in creative
work comes from deepening: sometimes, digging deep into the
earth you suddenly see a sparkle — an unexpected gem.
I use the banking system and do not understand it. I use the
telephone and do not comprehend its mechanism. I turn on
the television and all I know about television is how to turn it
on. I use man and do not know him. I use myself and . . .
ANGELA: . . . and I see everything with new perspectives: the
table where I write stretches beyond the length of a table, my
pen is enormously long and I must in order to write keep
myself far from the table so that the tip of the pen can reach
the paper that is whiter than paper. From the lampshade
gushes a great triangle of light upon the paper and my hand
and I make a huge shadow on the wall. Everything got larger.
I, the paper, the light and the pen are free in the boundless
field where golden wheat grows.
AUTHOR: I, alchemist of myself. Am I a man who devours
himself? No, it’s that I live in eternal mutation, with new
adaptations to my renewed living and I never reach the end of
any of the ways of existing. I live from unfinished and
vacillating sketches. But I try my best to balance between me
and I, between me and others, between me and the God.
I live in darkness of the soul, and my heart beating, eager for
future pulsations that cannot stop. But the occasional phrase
escapes the shadows and rises light and volatile to my surface:
then I note it here.
But what I wanted was to bring to my surface the rich
darkness itself that would be like petroleum gushing dark and
thick and rich.
I am not an informer but sometimes I happen to give news
that surprises even me.
When I concentrate I concentrate without meaning to and
without knowing how I manage to but I manage independent
of myself. Or better yet: it happens. But when I myself want to
concentrate then I distract myself and lose myself in the
“wanting” and end up only feeling the wanting that comes to
be the goal. And the concentration doesn’t happen. The desire
must be hidden to not kill the vital nerve of what you wanted.
Who orders me around, if not me? For I can’t manage to
reach myself.
What is the word that represents the “unknown” that we feel
within ourselves? I’ve adhered to the unknown for a long time
now. What is the reality of the world? because I don’t know.
Nature is not casual. For it repeats itself, and repeated
accidents become a law, those accidents that are not accidents.
I’m horrified and my brow is covered with cold sweat. Because
if what I can barely sense really is true — then I must
radically change my life.
What am I thinking? okay, I’ll try to explain with humid brow
and slightly shaking hand: here goes:
Perhaps — perhaps whatever is correct lies precisely in error?
If that’s true, how many fruitful “errors” I have lost. That
would contradict everything I learned and everything human
society taught me. Fearing the error, I degraded myself. To
avoid the error, I ventured nothing great. I, standing in the
street, cast a shadow on the ground. My shadow is my
opposite of the “correct,” my shadow is my error — and that
shadow-error belongs to me, only I possess it inside me, I am
the only person in the world whose lot it was to be me. So is
there an acquired right to be me? And now I want my errors
back. I reclaim them.
I want to forget that readers exist — and demanding readers
too who hope for I don’t know what from me. So I’ll take my
freedom into my hands and write I-don’t-care-what?, truly
awful, but me.
I am only sporadically. The rest is empty words, they too
sporadic.
An attempt to sensitize the language so that it shivers and
shakes and my earthquake opens frightening fissures in this
free language — but I captive and in the process of not being
I become aware and it goes on without me.
To get things started, let me assure you that you only live, real
life, when you learn that even the lie is true. I decline to offer
proof. But if someone insists on the “whys,” I’ll answer: the lie
is born in the person who creates it and it brings into
existence new lies from new truths.
One word is the lie of another.
I demandingly want you to believe me. I want you to believe
me even when I lie.
ANGELA: I’m not — I hope — judging myself with excessive
impartiality. But I need to be a bit impartial or else I succumb
and get tangled in my pathetic form of living. Besides physically
there’s something rather pathetic about me: my big eyes are
childishly interrogative at the same that they seem to ask for
something and my lips are always half-open like when you’re
surprised or when the air you breathe through your nose is
insufficient and so you breathe through your mouth: or the
way lips look when they are about to be kissed. I am, without
being aware of it, a trap.
Though I am wise, I don’t really understand what’s happening
to me. And the world demanding decisions from me for which
I am not prepared. Decisions not only about provoking the
birth of facts but also decisions about the best way to be.
A tension of the string of a violin.
I don’t understand my remotest past, childhood and
adolescence which lives without understanding and without
paying attention. I was giddy. Now without the slightest support
at the foundation of my life I am loose and perilous and
events come at me like something always discontinuous, not
connected to a previous understanding to which these events
would be an intelligible succession. But no: events don’t seem
to have their cause in me. I don’t properly understand what’s
happening to me. And my point of view regarding honors is
primary.
Why do I want to make a hero of myself? I in fact am
anti-heroic. What torments me is that everything is “for the
time being,” nothing is “always.” Life — from the moment
you’re born — is guided, idealized by dreams. I plan nothing, I
leap into the darkness and chew upon shadows, and in these
shadows I sometimes see the luminous and pure sparkling of
three inedible diamonds. So I rise to the surface with a
diamond in each pupil of my eyes in order to pass through
the opacity of the world and another between my half-closed
lips so that when I speak my words will be crystalline, hard
and dazzling.
AUTHOR: I wanted a very delicate, schizoid, elusive true kind
of writing that would reveal to me the unwrinkled face of
eternity. Obsessed with the desire to be happy I lost my life. I
moved with the tension of a bow and arrow in an unreality of
desires.
ANGELA: What’s missing in my writing is the dream. How
secret living is! My secret is life. I tell no one I’m alive.
AUTHOR: We’re living at the fin de siècle, wasting away in
decadence — or are we in the Golden Age? we’re on the
verge of an unfolding. On the verge of knowing ourselves. On
the verge of the year 2000.
The world? Its merciless and tragic history is my past. Could it
be that the word topaz has already been drained of its
thought? No, I still feel the shining of an energy in the
translucent golden word called topaz.
I’m a beggar with a beard full of lice seated on the sidewalk
crying. I’m no more than that. I’m neither happy nor sad. I’m
exempt and unscathed and gratuitous.
ANGELA: To sleep . . . With my heart all shut and unsteady,
my hand shaking, the intimate warmth of a sip of red wine.
And getting into a bed full of pillows and choosing the best
position. Then a murmur of prayer comes from my warm
blood. But I never can capture the zero-instant when I fall
asleep and sleeping I die.
It’s night and I went barefoot through the shadowy sands but
the sea was a thick outpouring of the dark night — and I was
scared like a little swallow. The black sea was calling me in the
undertow of the low tide, black surf.
After hardly sleeping all night I’m in a state of rustic vigilance.
And what my dreams should have been if I had slept at night
started happening by day: in any case these dreams turned up
and had to simply had to pass even through narrow gaps that
the day opens within me. So it’s impossible for me to stop
dreaming and letting my mind wander. I’m a skull that’s hollow
and with vibrating walls and full of bluish clouds: they are the
matter of sleeping and dreaming and not of being. I must
simply must invent my future and invent my path.
I want the shining gravel in the dark brook. I want the sparkle
of the stone beneath the rays of sun, I want death that frees
me. I could manage to have pleasure if I abstained from
thinking. Then I’d feel the ebb and flow of air in my lungs. I
try to live without past without present and without future and
here I am free.
It is morning. The world is as happy as an abandoned circus.
AUTHOR: It’s a very pretty day. There’s a misty rain, the sky
is dark and the sea turbulent. Souls flutter about the cemetery,
vampires are on the loose, bats huddle in their caves. Refuge
for mystery and terror. If suddenly the sun appeared I would
give a cry of astonishment and a world would crumble and
there wouldn’t even be time for everyone to flee the brightness.
The beings who feed on shadows.
I’m only interested in writing when I surprise myself with what
I write. I can do without reality because I can have everything
through thought.
Reality doesn’t surprise me. But that’s not true: I suddenly feel
such a hunger for the “thing to really happen” that I cry out
and bite into reality with my lacerating teeth. And afterwards
give a sigh over the captive whose flesh I ate. And again, for a
long while, I do without real reality and find comfort in living
from my imagination.
How Can You Transform
Everything into a Daydream?
AUTHOR: The fact is more important than the text.
Facts trip me up. That is why I am now going to write about
not-facts, that is, about things and their gaudy mystery.
The sensation of writing is curious. When I write I’m not
thinking about the reader or myself: then I am — but only
from me — I am the words strictly speaking.
ANGELA: I like words. Sometimes a random and scentillating
phrase occurs to me, without having anything to do with the
rest of me. From now on I’m going to write in this diary, on
days when there’s nothing else to do, phrases almost on the
edge of meaninglessness but that sound like words of love.
Saying meaningless words is my great freedom. It matters little
to me to be understood, I want the impact of dazzling syllables,
I want the noxiousness of a bad word. Everything is in the
word. What I’d give, however, not to have this mistaken desire
to write. I feel like I’m being pushed. By whom?
I want to write with words so completely stuck together that
there are no gaps between them and me.
I want to write really angry. As for me, I’m from far away.
Very far. And from me comes the pure smell of kerosene.
AUTHOR: The word is the defecation of the thought. It
glistens.
Every book is blood, it’s pus, it’s excrement, it’s heart torn to
shreds, it’s nerves cut to pieces, it’s electric shock, it’s
coagulated blood running like boiling lava down the mountain.
ANGELA: Oh I no longer want to express myself with words:
I want to do so with “I-kiss-you.”
AUTHOR: I occasionally, I who am writing, seek for every
word the unconscious pop of a mortifying feeling.
ANGELA: I want to write and can’t do it. I want to write a
story called: “A Foot.” And another called: “You’re So Severe.”
In what I write is there nothing between the lines? If that’s the
case, I’m lost.
The novel I want to write would be “It’s Like Trying to
Remember. And Not Being Able.”
“There’s a book inside all of us,” they say. And maybe that’s
why I wanted to expel from me a book that I’d write if I had
the talent, and also the perseverance.
I’m feeling like a mermaid out of water. On one half of me
the scales are jewels shining in the sun of life. For I came out
of the sea into life. And I wriggle my body atop a large rock
combing my long salty hair. I don’t know why I wrote that, I
think it’s so I won’t forget to take note of something.
I don’t write, for I’m lazy and fluttering. I want to live so
much and I think that writing isn’t living. That it’s enough to
feel. I can’t do anything for myself in this sense: I’ve already
freed myself from my typewriter and demand to be left to my
destiny.
AUTHOR: I don’t write because I want to, no. I write because
I must. Otherwise what would I do with myself?
Everything I’m being or doing or thinking has a musical
accompaniment. There are entire and consecutive days that are
accompanied by a powerful and gloomy organ. When I’m being
hard on myself the accompaniment is a quartet.
I almost don’t know what I feel, if in fact I feel at all.
Whatever doesn’t exist comes to exist when it receives a name.
I write to bring things into existence and to exist myself. Since
I was a child I’ve been searching for the breath of the word
that gives life to murmurings. The only reason I never became
a real writer is because I get too lost between the lives and
my life. And also because I need to put order in my life, in
that chaos from which this grave and non-assimilable life is
made. I can’t relate to my life.
Serious like a boy of 13. Serious like an open mouth singing.
The annunciation.
How rude: making me wait.
Seeing is a miracle. How can you describe a pyramid? How
can you describe a light turned on?
ANGELA: I’m so ashamed to write. Fortunately I don’t publish.
When we speak to God we shouldn’t use words. The only way
to make contact is by being alive and mute, like the needle of
a wise and unconscious compass.
AUTHOR: They objectify me when they call me a writer. I
never was a writer and never shall be. I refuse to have the
role of scribe in the world.
I hate it when they tell me to write or expect me to write. I
once received an anonymous letter spiritually offering me a
musical recital as long as I kept writing. The result: I stopped
completely. Who orders me around — only I know.
ANGELA: I don’t write complicated. It’s smooth like a gentle
sea with waves spreading out white and frigid: agnus-dei.
But does anyone hear me? So I cry out: mama, and I am a
daughter and I am a mother. And I have in me the virus of
cruel violence and sweetest love. My children: I love you with
my poor body and my rich soul. And I swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth. Entangled in terror. Amen.
In the performance of my obligations I put each thing in its
proper place. That’s right: the performance of my obligations.
To refer to the “discharge” of my obligations would suggest a
brown and ugly wound on the leg of a beggar and we feel so
guilty about the beggar’s wound and its filthy discharge and
the beggar is us, the banished.
So delicate and trembling like picking up a station with the
portable radio. Even new batteries sometimes refuse. And
suddenly it comes in weak or too loud the blessed station I
want, weightless as a mosquito. Has anyone ever talked about
the dry and brief little noise that the match makes when the
ember and orangish flame light up?
I’m waiting for the inspiration for me to live.
I like children so much, I’d love to publish a son named João!
AUTHOR: What this book is missing is a bang. A scandal. A
prison. But there will be no prison, and the bang is an
implosion.
Angela writes columns for the newspaper. Weekly columns, but
she’s not satisfied. Columns are not literature, they’re
subliterature. Other people might think they’re high quality but
she considers them mediocre. What she would like is to write a
novel but that’s impossible because she doesn’t have the
stamina for it. Her short stories were rejected by the
publishers, some of whom said that they were very far from
reality. She’s going to try to write a story within the “reality” of
others, but that would be debasing herself. She doesn’t know
what to do. Meanwhile her current tapestry goes on: she
weaves while her friends are talking. To occupy her hands, she
weaves for hours and hours. In her first and only exhibition of
tapestries. It seems she’s better at weaving than writing
columns.
Book of Angela
ANGELA: “Ladies and gentlemen: I am afraid my subject is
rather an exciting one and as I don’t like excitement, I shall
approach it in a gentle, timid, roundabout way”
[
MAX BEERBOHM]
“But I love excitement”
[
ANGELA PRALINI]
“The only thing that interests me is whatever cannot be
thought — whatever can be thought is too little for me”
[
ANGELA PRALINI]
AUTHOR: I need to be careful. Angela already senses that
she’s being driven by me. She must not detect my existence,
almost as we can’t detect the existence of God.
Angela apparently wants to write a book studying things and
objects and their aura. But I doubt she’s up to it. Her
observations instead of being fashioned into a book arise
casually from her way of speaking. Since she likes to write, I
write hardly anything about her, I let her speak for herself.
ANGELA: I’d really like to describe still lifes. For example, the
three tall and pot-bellied bottles on the marble table: bottles
silent as if home alone. Nothing of what I see belongs to me
in its essence. And the only use I make of them is to look.
AUTHOR: Needless to say Angela will never write the novel
that she puts off every day. She doesn’t know that she lacks
the capacity to deal with the making of a book. She’s
inconsistent. All she can do is jot down random phrases.
There’s only one area in which she, if she really were someone
to go through with a vocation, could have some continuity: her
interest in discovering the volatile aura of things.
ANGELA: Tomorrow I’ll start my novel of things.
AUTHOR: She won’t start anything. First of all because Angela
never finishes what she starts. Second because her sparse
notes for the book are all fragmentary and Angela doesn’t
know how to bring together and build. She’ll never be a writer.
That spares her the suffering of barrenness. She’s very wise to
put herself on the margins of life and enjoy the simple
irresponsible commentary. And she by not writing a book
escapes what I feel when I finish a book: the poverty of soul,
and a draining of the sources of energy. Could it be that
anyone says that writing is the work of the lazy?
This book the pseudo-writer Angela is making will be called
“Story of Things.” (Oneiric suggestions and incursions into the
unconscious.)
Angela is someone who sees and studies things in order to use
them for sculpture or because she likes sculpture. She’s such
an autonomous character that she is interested in things that
have nothing to do with me, the author. I observe her writing
about objects. It’s a free-form study in which I take no part.
Whereas for Angela things are personal for me the study of
the thing is too abstract.
ANGELA: Writing — I tear things out of me in pieces the way
a harpoon hooks into a whale and rips its flesh . . .
AUTHOR: . . . while I’d like to tear the flesh off words. For
each word to be a dry bone under the sun. I am the Day.
Only one thing connects me to Angela: we’re the human
species.
ANGELA: I don’t even know how to start. I only know that
I’m going to speak of the world of things. I swear that the
thing has an aura.
AUTHOR: Everyone who learned to read and write has a
certain desire to write. It’s legitimate: every being has something
to say. But you need more than desire in order to write.
Angela says, as thousands of people do (and they’re right):
“my life is a real novel, if I wrote it down no one would
believe me.” And it’s true. The life of every person is
susceptible to a painful deepening and the life of every person
is “unbelievable.” What should those people do? What Angela
does: write with no strings attached. Sometimes writing a single
line is enough to save your own heart.
ANGELA: This is a compact book. I beg pardon and
permission to pass. There’s still no explanation. But one day
there will be. The music of this book is “Rhapsody for Clarinet
and Orchestra” by Debussy. Trumpets by Darius Milhaud. It’s
the sexual revelation of what exists. The Wedding March from
Wagner’s Lohengrin. Georges Auric “The Speech of the
General.” And now — now I’ll begin:
— What is nature but the mystery that surrounds everything?
Each thing has its place. What the pyramids of Egypt tell us.
From the height of such incomprehension, from the top of the
pyramid, how many centuries, I contemplate thee, oh ignorance.
And I know the secret of the sphinx. She did not devour me
because I gave the right answer to her question. But I am an
enigma for the sphinx and nevertheless I did not devour her.
Decipher me, I said to the sphinx. And she fell mute. The
pyramids are eternal. They will always be restored. Is the
human soul a thing? Is it eternal? Between the hammer blows
I hear the silence.
AUTHOR: Because Angela is such novelty and unusual I get
scared. I’m scared in bedazzlement and fear in the face of her
impromptu talk. Am I imitating her? or is she imitating me? I
don’t know: but her way of writing reminds me ferociously of
mine as a child can resemble the father. The ancestral fathers.
I come from afar. I’m efficient, Angela isn’t. I give her some
room to move around as though she were a mechanical toy
and she sets to work clatteringly. I then remove the clatter
oiling her screws and coils. But she doesn’t operate under my
mechanistic approach: she only acts (through words) when I
let her be.
ANGELA: I can’t look at an object too much or it sets me on
fire. More mysterious than the soul is matter. More enigmatic
than the thought, is the “thing.” The thing that is miraculously
concrete in your hands. Furthermore, the thing is great proof
of the spirit. A word is also a thing — a winged thing that I
pluck from the air with my mouth when I speak. I make it
concrete. The thing is the materialization of aerial energy. I am
an object that time and energy gathered in space. The laws of
physics govern my spirit and gather in a visible block my body
of flesh.
Can paralysis transform a person into a thing? No, it can’t,
because that thing thinks. I am urgently needing to be born.
It’s really hurting me. But if I can’t get out of this situation, I’ll
suffocate. I want to scream. I want to scream to the world: I
am born!!!
And so I breathe. And so I have the freedom to write about
the things of the world. Because it’s obvious that the thing is
urgently begging for mercy since we abuse it. But if we’re in a
mechanistic age, we also give our spiritual cry.
The object — the thing — always fascinated me and in a
certain sense destroyed me. In my book The Besieged City I
speak indirectly about the mystery of the thing. The thing is a
specialized and immobilized animal. Years ago I also described
an armoire. Then came the description of an age-old clock
called Sveglia: an electronic clock that haunted me and would
haunt any living person. Then it was the telephone’s turn. In
“The Egg and the Hen” I speak of an industrial crane. It’s a
timid approach of mine to subverting the living world and the
threatening world of the dead.
No, life is not an operetta. It’s a tragic opera in which in a
fantastic ballet are mingled eggs, clocks, telephones, ice skaters
and the portrait of a stranger who died in 1920.
AUTHOR: Angela writes about objects as she would do
needlework. A lacemaking woman.
ANGELA: The thing dominates me. But the dog that exists in
me barks and there is an outburst of the fatal thing. There is
a fatal aspect to my life. I accepted long ago the fearful destiny
that is mine. Thank you. Thank you very much, my lord. I’m
leaving: I’m going to what is mine. My heart is as cold as the
small sound of ice in a glass of whiskey. One day I shall speak
of ice. Out of nervousness I broke a glass. And the world
exploded. And I broke a mirror. But I didn’t look at myself in
it. I’m going to investigate things. I hope they won’t avenge
themselves on me. Forgive me, thing, forgive my pitiful self. Ah
what a sigh of the world.
AUTHOR: Angela fell in love with the sight of “things.”
“Things” for her are an experience almost without the
atmosphere of any thought or common expression. However,
when she observes things, she acts with a tie that binds her to
them. She’s not immune. She humanizes things. So she’s not
honest in her intentions.
ANGELA: When I look, the thing comes to exist. I see the
thing in the thing. Transmutation. I sculpt with my eyes
anything I see. The thing itself is immaterial. What is called
“thing” is the solid and visible condensation of a part of its
aura. The aura of the thing is different from the aura of a
person. The aura of the latter ebbs and flows, disappears and
reappears, turns sweet or flies into a purple rage, explodes and
implodes. While the aura of the thing is always the same as
itself. The aura distinguishes things. And us too. And the
animals that are given the name of a breed and a species. But
my own aura trembles glittering when I see you.
AUTHOR: I wanted to write something wide and free. Not to
describe Angela but to lodge myself temporarily within her way
of being. Angela has but a meager thread of life. And she
doesn’t insist that anything unusual should happen to her. But
I want the intangible thing: the way she makes her way.
To look at the thing in the thing: its intimate meaning as
shape, shadow, aura, function. From now on I shall study the
profound still life of objects seen with delicate superficiality, and
an intentional one, for if it were not superficial it would sink
into the past or the future of the thing. I want only the
present state of the thing born from nature or the things
made by man. This way of feeling is so new to me that it’s a
revolution. In this my way of looking I see the aura of Angela.
When I look I forget that I am I, I forget I have a face that
gets excited and I transform all of myself into a single intense
gaze.
Angela when she writes is actually writing about her own aura:
I suddenly realized this now. It’s no use to nail her down
because it’s impossible to see her. All you can do is get to the
edge of her aura. Despite having a body Angela is intangible —
such are the humidly sparkling mutations of her personality.
I leave you for now to contemplate a dreaming Angela
innocently wondering: how will the first springtime be after my
death?
ANGELA: The “thing” is properly strictly the “thing.” The thing
is neither sad nor happy: it is thing. The thing has in itself a
plan. The thing is exact. Things make the following noise: chpt!
chpt! chpt! A thing is a mangled being. There is nothing more
alone than a “thing.”
First of all there exists the unity of beings by which each thing
is one with itself — it consists of itself, adheres to itself. And
so we reach the common conception of the brain as a kind of
computer and of human beings as simple autonomous
conscious.
AUTHOR: Does Angela have the spontaneity of an initiative or
is she just my echo repeated in seven caverns until she dies?
Nothing like that. What is it? This: I only hear myself in the
repeated echo because my voice initially gets confused with
myself.
ANGELA: I entered a silent realm of what is made by the
empty hand of man: I entered the domain of the thing. The
aura is the sap of the thing. Fluid emanations glaringly blind
my vision. I quiver trembling. I tremble quivering. There’s
something squalid in the air. I breathe it in greedily. I want to
fill myself with the physical properties of all that exists in
matter. The aura of the thing comes from the reverse of the
thing. My reverse side is a splendor of velvety light. I have
telepathy with the thing. Our auras overlap. The thing is inside
out and the wrong way.
AUTHOR: Angela wants to be fashionable. There’s been a lot
of talk about “auras.” So she writes about it. It’s not her fault
she’s a poor woman with nothing but money. Why doesn’t she
write about “how can you tell if a mosquito is male or
female”?
ANGELA: The spirit of the thing is the aura that surrounds
the shapes of its body. It is a halo. It is a breath. It is a
breathing. It is a manifestation. It is the freed movement of the
thing. I love objects that vibrate in their immobility just as I
am a part of the great energy of the world. I have so much
energy, that I place static things or those endowed with
movement on the same level of energy. I have within me,
object that I am, a bit of enigmatic sanctity. I feel it in certain
empty moments and I perform miracles within myself: the
miracle of the transitory sudden change, at a slight touch in
me, to suddenly change feelings and thoughts, and the miracle
of seeing everything hollow and clear: I see luminosity without
theme, without story, without facts. I make a great effort not to
have the worst of feelings: that nothing is worthwhile. And
even pleasure is unimportant. So I keep myself busy with
things. I’ve got a problem: it’s this: how long do things last? If
I leave a sheet of paper in a closed room would it attain
eternity? There is a time when things no longer end. Their
auras are petrified. If well taken care of, a piece of paper will
never end. Or is it transformed?
I ask you in what realm you were last night. And the answer
is: I was in the realm of whatever is free, I breathed in the
grand solitude of the dark and leaned over the edge of the
moon. The late night made such silence. Just like the silence of
an object placed upon a table: aseptic silence of “the thing.”
There also exists great silence in the sound of a flute: it
unwinds vast distances of hollow spaces of black silence until
the end of time.
AUTHOR: I don’t want to violate the soul of Angela and break
it into loose words without any intimate connection: but how
do I approach her without invading her? how to make a
speech out of something that’s no more than scream or
sweetness or nothing or craziness or vague ideal? Could it be I
have to use her in order to reveal a more inconsistent mode
that I too have within me? I who besides a desire for method,
want laughter or weeping like quick summer showers. One
proof that I misuse Angela’s scant life is that she writes with a
style that’s actually my own. The truth is that I’m going to
take advantage of Angela’s kind of audacity to venture a little
madness but with the guarantee of “returning.”
ANGELA: “
Woman-Thing.”
I’m the unworked raw material. I’m also an object. I have all
the necessary organs, like any human being. I feel my aura
which on this chilly morning is red and extremely sparkly. I
am a woman object and my aura is a vibrant and competent
red. I am an object that sees other objects. Some are brothers
to me and others are enemies. There are also objects that say
nothing. I am an object that uses other objects, that enjoys or
rejects them.
My face is an object so visible it’s embarrassing. I understand
those beautiful Arab women who have the wisdom to hide
their noses and mouths with a veil or white crêpe. Or purple.
So all that is exposed are the eyes that reflect other objects.
The gaze then gains such a terrible mystery that it looks like
the vortex of an abyss. I use scarlet-red lipstick: that’s my
provocation. I’ve got eyebrows that are always asking but don’t
argue, they are delicate. This face-object has a small and
rounded nose that allows the object that I am to sniff around
like a hunting dog. I have some secrets: my eyes are such a
dark green that they seem black. In photographs of this face
of which I speak to you with a certain solemnity my eyes
refuse to be green: a strange face appears in the photograph
with black and slightly Oriental eyes.
One object thinks of another object and our auras get
confused. And I have, I assure you, everything else that makes
me a woman sometimes living, sometimes object. My essential
stupidity however wants to tremble with light, to be glorified by
spirit. My heaviness needs the adventure of hazarding guesses.
This being who calls me to light, how I shall bless him! I shall
open myself to him in my stupidity which is a granite block.
Bells of gold are ringing in me sacred bells. And my purple
drapes have been ready. The color purple is abysmal and has
no end. Its noble intensity. I keep looking and going deeper
into the endlessness of the old clot as when I try to perforate
dense matter with my eyes. Purple leaves me pensive dreaming
and empty.
AUTHOR: Angela is obsessed with giving names to things. She
doesn’t know how to simply feel them without thinking.
What would become of me if not for Angela? the woman
enigma who makes me emerge from the nothing and head
toward the word.
ANGELA: “
Mother-Thing.”
I opened myself and you from me were born. One day I
opened myself and you were born for you yourself. How much
gold poured out. And how much rich blood was spilled. But it
was all worth it: you are the pearl of my heart that is shaped
like a bell of pure silver. I dissipated. And you were born. And
I erased myself so you could have the freedom of a god. You
are pagan but have the blessing of a mother.
And. And the mother is me.
A swollen mother. Mother sap. Mother tree. Mother who gives
and asks nothing in return.
Mother organ music.
Raise the flag, son, at the hour of my holy death. And I give
such a profound cry of horror and praise that things shatter
at the vibration of my only voice. Collision of stars. Through
the enormous monstrous telescope you see me. And I am icy
and generous as the sea. I die. And I come from afar like the
silent Ravel. I am a portrait watching you. But when you wish
to be alone with your girlfriend-wife cover my sweet face with
a dark and opaque cloth — and I shall see nothing. I am
mother-thing hanging from the wall with respect and sorrow.
But what deep happiness there is in being a mother. A mother
is crazy. So crazy that from her children are born. I nourish
myself with rich foods and you suck from me thick and
phosphorescent milk. I am your talisman.
AUTHOR: Angela, control yourself so as not to write a
tear-jerker about a poor boy with his mother dead.
ANGELA: “
Folding Screen.
”
My folding screen is made of round cylinders of jacaranda. I’d
almost say that jacaranda is sterling silver. As there is a small
gap between one cylinder and the next it remains open to
consequences. And its fragility is dangerous. Because when it
falls — and it falls at the slightest push — it smashes the
plants behind it. My screen is my way of looking at the world!
between-the-slats.
AUTHOR: In this talking of mine and of Angela’s, we both
transcend the bourgeoisie inside us. What drives me to despair
is the fact-idea that Angela is ambiguous in her existence: part
of her is independent, another part is the wife selected by me
like a chosen daughter.
Well, but with this book I, it seems I’m emancipating myself.
Which is good and about time. This almost emancipation also
leaves me standing and alone in the world. I don’t have
anything to nourish me: I eat myself.
ANGELA: “
State of the Thing.
”
The desert is a way of being. It’s a thing-state. By day it’s
torrid and devoid of pity. It’s the thing-earth. The dry thing in
thousands and thousands of trillions of grains of sand. By
night? So cold that sheet of air that furrows trembling with
such an intense cold of an intensity almost unbearable. The
color of the desert is not-a-color. The sands are not white,
they are the color of dirtiness. And the dunes, which like
echoes undulate feminine. By day the air sparkles. And there
are mirages. You see — because you so want to see it — an
oasis of humid and fertile earth, palms and water, shade, shade
at last for eyes that in the mad sun become emerald-green.
But when you get close — well: it simply never was. It was no
more than a creation of the sun in the uncovered head. The
body takes pity on the body. I am a mirage: because I so
long to see myself I do.
Ah, the dunes of the desert of the Sahara seem long asleep,
untransformable by the passing of days and of nights. If its
sands were white or colored, they would have “facts” and
“events,” which would shorten time. But with the color they
are, nothing happens. And when it does, a rigid, immobile,
thick, swollen, thorny, bristling, intractable cactus happens. The
cactus is full of rage with fingers all twisted and it’s impossible
to caress it: it hates you with each piercing spine because it
also feels the pain of the spine that pierced its own thick flesh
first. But you can cut it into pieces and suck its bitter sap: the
milk of a stern mother. To soften this life of mine that slowly
drips drop upon drop — I have the power of the mirage: I
see humid oases that vanish when I approach seeking maternal
shelter. A hard life is a life that seems longer. But, even so,
what surprises me is how it can already be May, if only
yesterday it was February? Each minute that comes is a
miracle that cannot be repeated.
AUTHOR: I don’t have a single answer. But I have more
questions than any man could answer.
ANGELA: The phrase “damp garden” gives me a gentle
happiness and a canticle spreading from me to me. The words
“drinking-well” and “pergola” also make me wet. Ah could I
but describe the delicate happiness they inspire in me, only
then would I be a writer. I’d be dizzy with pleasure.
AUTHOR: Angela doesn’t write. She moans.
ANGELA: I wanted to write luxuriously. To use words that
would shine wet and glistening and were pilgrims. Sometimes
solemn in purple, sometimes abysmal emeralds, sometimes so
light in the finest soft embroidered silk. I wanted to write
random phrases, phrases that would go beyond speaking back
to me: “the morning moon,” “gardens and gardens in shade,”
“astringent sweetnesses of honey,” “crystals that break with a
musical disastrous crash.” Or to use words that come to me
from my unknown: trapilíssima avante sine qua non masioty —
poor us and you. You are my lit candle. I am the Night.
AUTHOR: What I’m writing is an intense and basic work,
foolish like certain experiences that don’t collaborate with the
future and are therefore useless. What Angela writes is of an
essential superfluousness because her life even if superfluous
follows a freedom to and fro: while I Angela is always now.
One now follows another now and etc. and so on.
ANGELA: “
The Indescribable”
I bought a thing with which I fell absolutely in love: the price
doesn’t matter, this object is worth the very air.
This thing has a solid base of metal, very concise. In this
shining cylinder there is the slightest opening. In it you put
delicate and slender metal stems. And atop each stem there
sits in glory a tiny and round ball that looks like a jewel of
sterling silver.
This object is magical. A breath or a light touch of the hand is
enough — and it vibrates all over intermingling sparklingly with
the air. Is it an object of the moon or of the sun? it’s like
good news, like being happily startled, like a “suddenly.” It has
thirty little balls and stems. But it’s deceiving: when they start
to vibrate and move they’re like a delicate trillion little balls.
There’s one more thing it has: when the lights in the room
come on, the little balls cast a shadow, greenish.
And there’s more: when it vibrates as a result of the slight
shock of the balls against each other — some musical notes
result. And the object if well made and induced sings swiftly —
a swift Do Re Mi . . .
“Grabbing the word.” I grab the word and make it thing.
I grabbed joy and made it like a brilliant crystal in the air. Joy
is a crystal. Nothing needs to have shape. But the thing
absolutely must in order to exist.
“
Silver Box”
Has it ever occurred to you to feel sorry for an object? I have
a medium-sized silver box and it inspires pity in me. I don’t
know what in this silent, immobile object makes me understand
its solitude and the punishment of eternity. I don’t place
anything inside the box so that it won’t be burdened.
And the heavy lid encloses the void. I always place flowers
around it so they can relieve the life-death of the box — the
flowers are also an homage to the anonymous artisan who
sculpted in heavy sterling silver a work of art.
“
The House
”
This is a castle of solid stone. But its aura is a nest of soft
moonlight. Upon it the sun shines like a mirror.
The greatest thing one can have is the house. Beethoven
understood this and composed a resplendent symphonic
overture called “The Consecration of the House.” I heard this
music that reassures me at six-thirty on a still sleepy morning.
Hearing such remarkable music provoked a delirious dream in
which the things of the house moved around and were
bewitched. So I thought: I must simply must have enormous
corollas of fine smooth but wild feathers to place in my house.
I looked at the stone upon the table. It was large and very
heavy. I plunged into vague meditation. I looked at it. Almost
black. And inexorable.
One way of living more is to use your senses in a context not
properly their own. For example: I see a marble table that is
naturally to be seen. But I stroke as subtly as possible its
form, I feel its coldness, I imagine the scent of “thing” the
marble must have, scent that for us exceeds the smell barrier
and we can’t feel it through our noses, we can only imagine it.
The teapot so slender, elegant and full of grace. Yes, but all
this passes in an instant, and what is left is an old and slightly
chipped teapot, ordinary object.
AUTHOR: I don’t know what the climax of this book will be.
But, as Angela goes on writing, I’ll recognize it.
ANGELA: “
The Clock”
You feel in the clock time vibrating. Meanwhile, that is, while I
look at the hours of the clock life is evaporating and my heart
becomes an object that sparkles. If I were God I would see
man, at a distance, as thing. We are of divine construction.
The clock is a torturing object: it seems shackled to time. The
second hand, if we kept watching it move mechanically and
inexorably, would put us in a frenzy.
“
Iron Guardrail”
Bad weather.
I, deteriorated.
At the back of the courtyard I saw an iron guardrail in a
sorry state, all corroded and peeling with rust. I lingered staring
at it, without getting any closer. I didn’t know why I was
staring at it with such concentration. And suddenly it seemed
that the guardrail was looking at me. It was tall and rose with
an intensity of thing. I felt consecrated. Afterwards I gave a
deep sigh with my eyes shut, and I opened them again as if I
had been sleeping and finally awoke, forgetting my dream, I
awoke arriving from very far within myself. I breathed deeply
and looked once again at the slender rail. And as I looked I
saw that that haughty thing was nothing, it wasn’t looking at
me, and would cross another century.
AUTHOR: The process that Angela has for writing is the same
process as the act of dreaming: what starts forming are
images, colors, acts, and especially an atmosphere of dreams
that resembles a color and not a word. She doesn’t know how
to explain herself. All she knows is how to do and to do
without understanding herself.
ANGELA: “
The Car
”
The photographer Francis Giacobetti, of the magazine Lui,
spends all of his working hours taking nude portraits of the
most beautiful girls in and around Paris.
He was asked, in an article about nudes published in the latest
L’Express, what he most liked photographing, above all else?
“Not women, no. Trucks. They’re beautiful, trucks . . .”
The red scream.
The scarlet-red car let out a purple howl. That “thing” had a
horn. And it screamed calling the attention of passers-by. And
of God. That “thing” has coils, it has rubber, it has a radio.
AUTHOR: Angela sometimes writes phrases that have absolutely
nothing to do with what she’d been discussing. I think these
unexpected interferences are like electric static that interferes
and gets mixed up with the music on the radio. The electrical
currents in the air simply stick to her. And if that happens it’s
because she doesn’t know how to write, she writes everything,
without selecting. I myself, if I’m not careful, sometimes pick up
some electrical interference and suddenly start talking about an
orange tractor. The tractor comes to mind because I’m
unintentionally plagiarizing Angela.
ANGELA: Example of a phrase that’s enigmatic and completely
hermetic like a closed thing: “calibrating tires.” Those words
delight and seduce me. To calibrate is to give caliber, isn’t it?
Yes. So when I see a sign on a truck reading: “Inflammable”
— then I am filled with glory.
A mobile crane mounted on a Scania-Vabis chassis and with
an 18 – 22 ton capacity. It’s the “Iron Giraffe,” originally called
“Hudra Truck 18/22-T and which is being manufactured in
Brazil. Initially, the production schedule estimates three monthly
units increasing to five, next year, with great export
possibilities.”
And so I see that the crane will have children and one day
will populate the earth. Which will be a world of objects. But
the objects no longer want to be objects. It’s the revolt of the
“thing.” The catastrophe of things is a noisy racket in the air.
Only for the supersonic.
AUTHOR: A fatal mechanization makes Angela see “things”
more and not human beings.
ANGELA: “
Record Player
”
On the record the black circumvolutions avoid mixing with
other magic circles by a hair: and from there comes the aura
of music. I have a musical aura. The record I pick it up and
run the hairs of my arm across and the hairs stand on end.
Because its aura touches mine.
“
Butterfly”
The mechanics of the butterfly. First it’s the egg. Later the egg
breaks and a caterpillar comes out. This caterpillar is
hermetically sealed. It isolates itself atop a leaf. Inside it is a
cocoon. But the caterpillar is opaque. Until it starts turning
transparent. Its aura shines, it fills with colors. Then from the
caterpillar that opens itself there emerge small fragile legs. At
that the entire butterfly comes out. Then the butterfly slowly
opens its wings above the leaf — and takes off fluttering, light,
happy, a little crazy. Its life is brief but intense. Its mechanics
are higher mathematics.
I saw a black butterfly. It cursed me.
AUTHOR: She turns a butterfly into an epic. And she’s
unorthodox.
ANGELA: Living is almost intolerable.
I see death smiling in your beautiful face like the fatal stain of
the face of Christ on Veronica’s veil.
If we could stay quiet — suddenly an egg is born. An
alchemical egg. And I’m being born and I’m breaking the dry
shell of the egg with my lovely beak. I’m born! I’m born! I’m
born!
My soul is racked by desire.
Oh scarlet eggplant, what are you? are you a thing? bitter as
life itself. I’m going to try everything I can, I don’t want to
keep distant from the world.
AUTHOR: Angela — if she really could write — would give us
her rough ideas because she’s incapable of addressing a
possible reader with the spontaneous lack of order she uses to
write this book. She thinks that contact with the reader can
only happen through complicated reasoning.
ANGELA: “
Trash Can”
The trash can is a luxury. Because who doesn’t have things to
put out in the street the things that aren’t any use? and yet
we have a container made just for our rubbish. If we threw
our trash onto the street it would become a federal problem.
Scrap metal is the most beautiful garbage there is.
“I’m clean and don’t smell. But as fate would have it they fill
me with filth and dirt. Only mutts understand me. ‘She’ lines
me with newspaper: Jornal do Brasil. And I unafraid pretend I
have no owner. I receive stubbed-out butts of cigarettes. One
day I’ll catch fire. At night I’m alone in the dark, empty, left in
the corner on the ground. My silence stinks. Woe is me,
receptacle of the death of things.”
The number is itself.
The flower is from May 14th.
Numbers . . . are they what’s hidden behind your mysteries,
secret effluvia and succulent secretions or, maybe, sibilant and
pointed questions without any answers? What do they hide,
clouds?
As for the sea. The sea is impossible to believe. Only by
imagining it can you manage to see its reality. Only as a
possible dream does the sea exist. But the bottomlessness of
the sea blossoms inside me with the scare of a scarecrow.
A vase with pale roses already wilting is a phantasmagoric thing
that profoundly frightens me when it catches me unawares.
They threaten to throw into the air their own aura that
becomes a ghost.
And the picture of painted roses gives a smile. I’m afraid of
living roses because they are so fragile and dandyish and
because they turn yellow. But painted roses they don’t frighten
me.
To be alone is a state of being. I learned this from things. It’s
obvious, it’s clear that things tend to be alone. But a living
room set is so lonely!
The armchair is mute, it’s fat, it’s cozy. It greets every backside
like any other. It’s a mother. On the other hand the edge of a
table is a fateful weapon. If you were thrown against it, you’d
double over in pain. A round table is sly. But it presents no
danger: it’s a bit mysterious, it smiles slightly.
AUTHOR: Angela has an enviable quality: she’s chatty when
she describes “things,” she seems to bear good news.
ANGELA: You shouldn’t live in luxury. In luxury we become
an object that in turn possesses other objects. You only see
the “thing” when you live a monastic life or at least a
temperate life. The spirit can live on bread and water.
The violin mute thing exhales restrained music but with sleeping
eyes. A violin that reaches the paroxysm of piercing sound: the
glory of being.
Matchsticks flare restless inside the sealed box, mad for the
sexual act that consists of being struck on the black part of
the box and transforming into fire. Yet the match does not
know that it will catch and burn but a single time.
“
The Jewel”
It shines. This it without equal. It is always unique. And has
sacred rage.
But when it’s a pearl necklace it shines softly like the piety of
an Ave Maria. A pearl necklace needs to be in contact with
our skin in order to receive our heat. Otherwise it dies. One,
two, three, seven, how many pearly eggs of mother-of-pearl?
And it ends with the most delicate clasp of diamonds set in
white gold.
White gold? it turns pale in terror: threat.
Whereas sun-gold gives itself openly like a glory of love. A long
gold chain runs through the fingers like warm water of a
brook between sunlit pebbles. Sun-gold doesn’t refuse. But —
but, my God, how dangerous is the gold ingot. Men kill for a
yellow brick.
A woman sells herself for a diamond. And a greedy one asks
for more: she wants a very wide stole of warm mink.
Brilliants are small joys in a shower of children’s laughter.
They’re cold little waterfalls in bursts of trembling giggles. Oh
how cold. I prefer the word brilliants to diamonds. I’m not
sure why: maybe because the word “brilliant” actually seems to
shine brilliantly with its flashes of diagonal light, it’s a word that
seems not to consist only of itself, of a single brilliant, but to
contain a shower of brilliants, like illuminated and transparent
eyes. Brilliants are a joy of the earth, they jump about and
when still seem like stars. In fact, brilliants are never still: their
crystalline light is refractory to immobility. A brilliant lights up
any setting and one’s eyes become gently cleared. But a
diamond is something chained to the earth, it’s solid, and the
word “diamante,” “diamond,” is a bit opaque despite its first
two syllables: “dia,” “day.” And the end “amante,” “lover,”
reveals a carnal and imperishable love. The brilliant is poetically
irresponsible, whereas the diamond-stone is circumspect and
stable.
But a brooch is serious. It’s an argument. It leaps into the air
like a woman-gazelle. It fastens, it’s weighty, it waits. And when
unfastened — everything becomes naked, the curtain falls and
the white breasts seem to blush. The brooch is a period.
Exclamations are the dangling earrings that tremble between
strands of hair. An earring made of what? made of everything
that knows how extremely important it is to shine. Earrings are
extremelies. And the earring of a single and modest pearl is
the violet of jewels. But diamond earrings fight and utter small
cries that frighten me. They quarrel, cruel. An earring of
sterling silver is seriousness and a guarantee of great and strict
security. A gold earring is any old “this,” it’s a little this without
much importance. Unless it’s a round ball of gold: then it’s
possession and activity.
Instantaneous is the light and brief ring of pearls. And when
there are many pearls on the ring — they are a smile and an
ellipsis. Between parentheses is the ring of diamonds set in
white gold because in secret it says an “I-love-you” in Greek.
AUTHOR: I realize with surprise but with resignation that
Angela is controlling me. She even writes better than I do.
Now our ways of speaking are intersecting and getting
confused.
ANGELA: Wild coral is jagged and the isle of Capri in the sun.
A coral necklace cannot be grabbed by the hand: it wounds
the delicate shell of that white and nervous hand.
Around the neck, the coral necklace is Christ’s crown of
thorns.
Ah! The diadem! I am the queen! I blaze like the high crown
that I am. Kings use me in the shape of a papal triangular
hood. Young princesses adorn with delicate diadems their fresh
and innocent faces that are yet capable of cruelty. Marie
Antoinette crowned and lovely, months before her head was
chopped off and rolled in the street, cried out melodiously: if
the people have no bread, let them eat cake. And the response
was: allons enfants de la patrie, le jour de gloire est arrivé.
The people devoured what they could and ate jewels and ate
trash and guffawed. Meanwhile the pale face of Marie
Antoinette displayed pearly silence on a head without hair and
without a neck.
Jade grants me divinity. Its traversable green sanctifies me as a
Byzantine icon. I, hands clasped together before my serious
and transparent face and my diadem are then the entwined
braids of my vigorous and tranquil strands of black hair. Jade
is my sword unsheathed for the hara-kiri of my humble proud
soul that kills itself because it has so little of everything, it’s
poverty-stricken, but it has the sovereign pride of death.
But — but only the diamond cuts glass.
And now I’m going to say something very serious, pay
attention: a shard of glass is a rare jewel. And its shattering is
a sound to be heard on bended knee like the tolling of bells.
Elegant bells that are jewel things too. Bells are the jewels of
the church. And the clapper of the bell is a ringing of gold
that shatters in the air in diamonds and blue birds.
A fiery horse is the ruby in which I plunge so deep that I
tear myself apart.
And the emerald? The emerald is something to gnaw with your
teeth, and shatter into a thousand little shards of small green
children of emeralds.
Topaz is the transparency of your gaze.
The stone? the stone on the ground? It’s a jewel that came
from the sky in a whirlwind and stopped right there until I
came and saw it and grabbed it and felt it like something of
my own, something of my heart.
And the sapphire? it has a reflection that blinds the eyes of
the reckless who buy sapphires as if they were diamonds. I’ve
never seen a sapphire. I only know what I’ve heard. But the
day I come face-to-face with a sapphire — ah! it’ll be sword
against sword and we’ll see if I’ll be the one from whom the
blood will gush.
The bracelet enslaves me, oh sweet enslavement of a woman
to her favorite man.
Platinum is the most expensive. But I don’t want you, you’re
ferocious in your white iciness. I prefer the cheap jewelry of a
poor woman who buys in the public market diamonds taken
from the purest water of the murky sewers.
Amethyst, I do not kiss you because I am not your servant.
Onyx! black prince of roses, you make me bitter and I swim
in the waters — darkness of your iron grip, oh mourning of a
queen! downy black spider. May you be cursed, black stone of
blood, clot of humors and miasmas.
Aquamarine? when I was a child my first boyfriend had blue
aquamarine eyes. But I didn’t get close to him: I was afraid.
Because still waters run deep and gave me chills.
Jewel
Frisson
Betrayal
But profound regret
And me, just me, resting alert inside the jewel-box of purple
velvet.
AUTHOR: Angela — of course — has a conscious mind that
doesn’t get along well with her subconscious. Is she double?
and is her life double? Like this: on the one hand there’s the
attraction to intellectualized things, on the other, something that
seeks the comforting and mysterious and free darkness,
unafraid of danger.
ANGELA: “
Elevator”
My elevator suddenly refused to elevate or lower me. It was
simply moving between floors, opening the door automatically
and presenting me with the slap in the face of a wall. For
days: sulky, angry, vindictive. Pointless because no one wished
it ill. We were only using its energy. But it got irritated and
decided to be rude. It needed a lot of oil and a lot of
back-and-forth to finally make up with us and lower and
elevate us.
What I can’t tolerate is fuss. The object is mute, it’s without
any fuss.
There was a gaze of the atmosphere of the room upon me. I
felt that gaze like a mysterious comfort.
As for how the rotation of the stars produces the inertia of my
ashtray — explain it if you can.
AUTHOR: Angela sometimes nauseates me like a chocolate
ice-cream soda.
ANGELA: The retch of perplexity.
The sky is concentrated air. It’s the void.
Rotten wood.
Careful, Nature thinks.
AUTHOR: Careful with what? and what does she mean Nature
thinks? She’s out of her mind.
ANGELA: If you think we’re made of wax you’re gonna pay.
AUTHOR: For those who write, an idea without words is not
an idea. Angela is full of pre-words and unconscious auditory
visions of ideas. My job is to cut out her drivel and leave
behind only what she at least manages to stammer.
ANGELA: Man sits. Why? Is sitting down something we’ve
acquired slowly through process across millennia? Or is it part
of human nature? As it’s in a bird’s nature to fly? Lying down
is different: except for feathered creatures, every animal lies
down.
I sometimes feel such pity for “things.” That small table with
the marble top, poor thing so cold and white and pale and
proud in vain. It thinks it’s noble. And my trash basket full of
paper, so elegant and simple, woven from strips of wood but
what’s the point of its beauty if it’s always on the floor, always
full of the crumpled paper of the letters I didn’t send.
Farewell, oh thing.
I’m leaving for when-hell-freezes-over.
AUTHOR: Angela lacks the creative ambition that is made of a
hunger that is never satisfied.
Discovering a new way to live. I believe that the key lies in
seeing the thing in the thing, without going beyond or behind
it, outside its context. The result of such a new way of looking
at the passing moment is often to wonder at a thing as if we
were seeing it for the first time. Seeing the thing in the thing
hypnotizes the person looking at the dazzling object seen. There
is an encounter between me and that thing vibrating in the air.
But the result of that gaze is a sensation of hollowness, empty,
impenetrable and of full mutual recognition. God forgive me I
believe I’m rambling on about the nothing. But I’m sure of one
thing, this nothing is the best character in a novel. In the void
of the nothing facts and things insert themselves. What you see
in this way of transforming everything absolutely into the
present state, the result is not mental: it is a mute form of
feeling absolutely untranslatable by words.
I’m only going to reread superficially what I’ve already written
and what Angela wrote because I don’t want to influence
myself, I don’t want to copy. I don’t want to imitate even the
truth. Perhaps by reading only superficially what’s already been
written will I lose the thread and everything will come out
fragmentary and disconnected. Or maybe it’s disconnected
because I speak of one thing that belongs to my path, while
Angela speaks of another thing that belongs to her destiny.
But, though I am fragmentary and dissonant and out of tune,
I believe there exists in all this a hidden order. And! There
exists a will.
AUTHOR: I’m in love with a character I invented: Angela
Pralini. Here she is speaking:
ANGELA: Ah how I would like a languid life.
I am one of the interpreters of God.
AUTHOR: When Angela thinks of God, is she referring to God
or to me?
ANGELA: Who makes my life? I feel that someone is ordering
me around and fating me. As if someone were creating me.
But I am also free and don’t obey orders.
AUTHOR: I’ve been drinking too much. When you drink, you
end up with a naked subconscious and can only feel, feel, feel.
God is a thing you breathe. I don’t have faith in God. Luck is
sometimes not having faith. Because that way one day you can
have The Great Surprise of those who don’t expect miracles. It
seems moreover that miracles happen like manna from heaven
especially for those who believe in nothing. And those people
don’t even realize that they were singled out. I’ve grown tired
of asking. For the miracle to happen you have to not expect it.
I want nothing more.
I am the night and He is the firefly.
The theme of my life is the nothing.
Reality is very strange, it’s entirely unreal. Why hast thou
forsaken me, my God? I live my life apologizing and giving
thanks.
Angela gave God the power to cure her soul. It’s a God of
great utility: for when Angela feels God then the terribly
exposed truth is immediate. Angela uses God to breathe. She
divides God to use Him as her protection. Angela is not a
mystic and doesn’t even see the golden light in the air.
ANGELA: I wanted to lead an ascetic life, of purification, of
exclusive contact with the beyond. But how? If at the same
time I want money for my comforts, I want a man for my
sensuality, I want the precious stones that are the gem of the
earth and that are for that reason also sacred? My duality
surprises me, I’m dizzy and unhappy. At the same time it’s a
richness to have the element sky-air and the element
earth-love, without one getting in the way of the other.
The moment I grasp myself — I shall have reached eternity no
matter how ephemeral.
God was not made for us. We are the ones who were made
for Him. What we must do, though He doesn’t care for us, is
adore Him and in the worst circumstances fill our hearts with
the pleasure of praising Him.
AUTHOR: A man imagined God and made a chair, in that
chair there must be a bit of that man’s energy. Such is the
spirit of made things, lived things.
I invented God — and don’t believe in Him. It’s as if I had
written a poem about the nothing and then suddenly found
myself face-to-face with the nothing itself. Is God a word? If so
then I’m full of Him: thousands of words crammed inside a
jar that’s shut and that I sometimes open — and I am
dazzled. God-word is dazzling.
ANGELA: Sometimes, just to feel myself living, I think about
death. Death justifies me.
An object ages because it has within it dynamics.
Instead of saying “my world,” I say audaciously: the world
depends on me. Because if I don’t exist, the Universe ceases
within me. Could it be that abstraction begins after death?
I, reduced to a word? but what word represents me? I know
one thing: I am not my name. My name belongs to those
who call me. But, my intimate name is: zero. It is an eternal
beginning permanently interrupted by my awareness of
beginning.
God is neither the beginning nor the end. He is always the
middle.
AUTHOR: I participate in Angela’s shaking restlessness but do
not imitate her.
ANGELA: I’m weak, dubious, there’s a charlatan inside me
though I tell the truth. And I feel guilty about everything. I
who have crises of rage, “sacred rage.” And I can’t find the
refuge of peace. For pity’s sake, let me live! I ask for little, it’s
almost nothing but it’s everything! peace, peace, peace! No, my
God, I don’t want peace with an exclamation mark. I want
only this minimum: peace. Just so, very, very slowly . . . like
this . . . almost asleep . . . that’s right . . . that’s right . . . it’s
almost coming . . . Don’t frighten me, I am terribly frightened.
He is the well-applied word. And I rolling through space like a
baby without gravity. Where’s my gravity? Or are you
supposed to say gravitation? Do me a favor, give me
somewhere to land. I’m not someone to believe in. But to
imagine without managing to. It makes me want to talk wrong.
Like: Dog. That means God.
AUTHOR: Angela doesn’t know how to live gradually: she
wants to eat life all at once. And so she’s got empty time left
over. The meditation inside the emptiness is what she manages,
being at the last human stage before our lives that are without
exception glorious.
Solitary eagle.
Living is a hobby for her. She thinks it has nothing to do with
her and lives tossed to the side, without past or future; just
today forever.
ANGELA: Is what’s happening to me Grace? Because my body
I don’t feel it, it doesn’t weigh me down, it doesn’t desire, the
spirit neither strains nor searches, a luminous aura of silence
envelops me: I hover in the air, free of time but fully in this
very moment, without before or after. I greet myself and the
world does not touch me. For me to be two and for there to
be the participation of this state, I look at myself in the mirror,
I look at the other of me. And I see that my fluid appearance
has the loveliness of the floating human face. Then I feel with
a most delicate pleasure that I’m whole. And an air of truth. I
am finally barefoot.
I did what was most urgent: a prayer.
I pray to find my true path. But I discovered that I don’t give
myself entirely to the prayer, I seem to know that the true
path is with pain. There is a secret and to me
incomprehensible law: only through suffering does one find
happiness. I fear myself because I’m always ready to be able to
suffer. If I don’t love myself I’ll be lost — because no one
loves me to the point of being I, of being me. I must want
myself in order to give something to myself. Must I be worth
something? Oh protect me from myself, who persecutes me.
I’m worth something in relation to others — but in relation to
myself, I am nothing.
It’s so good to have someone to ask for things. It doesn’t
even bother me much if my requests aren’t totally satisfied. I
ask God to make me prettier — and isn’t it true that my eye
shines as my lips seem fuller and sweeter? I ask God for
everything I want and need. That’s what I can do. Whether
my prayers are answered — that’s not up to me, that’s already
the matter-magic that either gives itself to me or withholds
itself. Stubborn, I pray. I don’t have the power. I have the
prayer.
AUTHOR: I’m so in contact with God that I don’t even need
to pray. It’s natural that Angela resembles me a bit. I’ve even
infected her with the mysterious belief I have.
I am afraid to be who I am.
There is a total silence within me. I get scared. How to explain
that this silence is what I call the Unknown. I’m afraid of It.
Not because It could childishly punish me (punishment is
something people do). The fear comes from what surpasses
me. And that also is me. Because my greatness is great.
I don’t live dangerously in facts. I live in extreme danger when
alone I fall into deep meditation. That is when I dangerously
become free even of God. And free even of me. At the edge
of a precipice dumbstruck on the dry height of a cliff. And as
a living thing beside me — only the cactus with its crown of
thorns of a nature that forsook me. I am alone from myself.
I constantly got lost inside me. I need the patience of a saint. I
am a man who chose silence. I had to love a pure being.
Ah, melancholy of having been created. I’d rather have stayed
in the immanescence of nature. Ah, divine wisdom that makes
me move without knowing what legs are for.
Does God know He exists?
I think God doesn’t know He exists. I’m almost certain He
doesn’t. And hence His powerful strength.
I cried a lot today and my eyes got swollen and red. But it
was worth it. I don’t even wonder why I cried.
The worst part is that I’m vice versa and zigzag. I’m
inconclusive. But I have to love myself the way I involuntarily
am. I only take responsibility for what’s voluntary in me and
that is very little.
I do not understand, therefore I believe. I believe “in what.”
Do you know what God is? God is time. I’m barely a part of
this itinerary heading toward Nothing. I wonder with an already
rather morbid insistence why was I born. I swear it’s not
worth the bother for anyone to be me. As for Angela, she
keeps up with fashion. For example: people talk a lot these
days about “human condition,” “existence,” “aura.” Why the
devil doesn’t she instead of wanting to dominate objects
dedicate herself to figuring out if an insect is male or female?
Women have that problem, keeping up with fashion. I don’t
know what the fashion is now but I know it’s time for sex
and violence. I myself only watch horror films. There’s a cold
war that’s finishing me off.
Time is the indefinable. I quickly put myself in time, before
dying. Life is very quick, when you see it, you’ve reached the
end. And to top it off we’re required to love God.
There’s a narrow passage inside me, so narrow its walls
wound me all over, but that passage leads to the breadth of
God. I don’t always have the strength to cross this bloody
desert, even knowing that, if I force myself to hurt all over
between the walls, even knowing that I’ll come out into the
open light of a day trembling with gentle sunshine.
ANGELA: I went trembling to encounter myself — and found a
silly woman flailing between the walls of existence. I smash the
floodgates and create myself anew. And then I can meet I, on
equal footing.
Did I consecrate myself to God?
AUTHOR: I, vigilant as a lit candle. Watching over the
mysteries of Angela.
Angela doesn’t know how to define. That’s why for her the
world is much vaster than mine. Not that I know how to
define but I’m aware of the limits and limiting yourself makes a
possible definition easier.
Angela has a gift that I find very moving: the gift of error.
Her whole life is a big mistake. The way she realizes that
something inside her is wrong, and very gravely wrong is her
anxiety, her permanent suspicion. She lives askance. Another
way she feels that there’s a fundamental error in her life is
through her humility and her innocence. The wicked are the
ones who must be forgiven. The innocent have forgiveness
within themselves.
I do not approve of myself because I can hardly stand to live
with myself. I do almost the impossible to be exempt. Exempt
from myself. I’m almost reaching that state of blessedness.
ANGELA: Today I bought a long dress with tones of
emerald-green, scarlet-red, loud-white, severe-black, king-blue,
insane-yellow.
God is like listening to music: He fills the being.
AUTHOR: She doesn’t seem to have what one might call
“elevated feelings.” She’s selfish and covetous. She won’t let
anyone go partly out of love, partly because she doesn’t know
how to break things off — but partly because of the nearly
luxurious material comfort people give her. She’s happy in the
diamonds she receives from time to time.
She’s not immobile: her active imperfections give her great
mobility. It’s in sin itself that Angela encounters her God. She’s
frivolous. Everything she touches turns frivolous. But when I tell
her that, she answers with a text she copied from Reader’s
Digest: “Joseph Haydn, criticized for the lightness of his music,
smiled: I cannot make it otherwise; I write according to the
thoughts I feel. When I think upon God, my heart is so full of
joy that the notes dance and leap, as it were, from my pen;
and since God has given me a cheerful heart, it will be
pardoned me that I serve Him with a cheerful spirit.”
I’ve discovered why I breathed life into Angela’s flesh, it was to
have someone to hate. I hate her. She represents my terrible
faith that is reborn every single morning. And it’s frustrating to
have faith. I hate this creature who simply seems to believe.
I’m sick of her empty God that she fills up with nervous
ecstasies. When did the hate in me start to happen and live?
And I get all dizzy with the effluvia of a sentiment I ignored in
myself for as long as I can remember.
Could it be that I want Angela Pralini in order to develop a
feeling that is ardent and sleepless, the feeling of hatred I now
need to exercise because she taught me to hate? Are we
forever attached? I want her. I know that one day I’ll leave
her, but my fear is that I won’t forget her and shall ever bear
that dark stain on my soul. This soul that’s always surprised
by the novelty of feeling.
For I bathe entirely in that devouring darkness, I want to
know the depth of my hatred. I want to know every feeling.
Must a person have experienced this cursed power in order to
be a complete person? I don’t know, but it’s demonic.
I’m making a shameful confession: it’s good to hate her. My
soul, a potential murderer, knows therefore the rich darknesses
of blood, and what I know makes me feel the worst of myself.
And, yes, the murderous soul is rich. I sometimes wonder if
she wants me to kill her to bring me to the summit of my
hatred. It’s better to forget her because otherwise my own
blood begins to hurt me and I’ll be filled with a black revolt
without at least knowing what I’m revolting against, that’s a lie
I know quite well what I’m revolting against. But it’s something
that can’t be said.
I get tense thinking of the kind of relaxation in which Angela
lives. I can’t reach her — now she escapes me, now she’s
close at hand — and when I think she’s within my reach, she
rebels, intrinsic.
Time is not measurable.
Angela makes no plans. And she scares herself because she’s
always a novelty. Sometimes she takes refuge in an
impenetrable nest. For example: just now I lost sight of her
and don’t know where she lives (hidden within me in a dark
corner of mine?). And I no longer know what she’s going to
say. I trust in her unpredictable drive.
Angela Pralini is sometimes unfettered and slightly sharp like
the voices of singing boys performing Bach cantatas, or a
chorus of monks. Angela is my vocal exercise.
Angela, I don’t know how to tell you and begin, without
hurting you. But I can’t stand you anymore. I’m going to
invent another woman quickly. One who won’t be magical like
you, one in whom I can go about walking the earth and
eating meat. I want a real woman. I’m tired of lying.
I’m going to invent a whole woman, who’s organized and
logical, who has a propensity like that of a surgeon. Or even a
lawyer. And who in bed is limpid and without sin. I’m going to
live with her. I’d feel more secure than I do with Angela. What
wears me out is that she’s impossible to domesticate. There’s a
false balance of contrary forces. She’s afraid — with good
reason — of living moment to moment, crippled in spirit. What
can I do if she’s anarchical?
Except imitate her since she’s stronger than I: I am the
product of a thought, she is not a product: she is all herself.
She shattered my system. She’s my ancestor and such my
pre-history that she manages to be inhuman, though she writes
with false order.
Angela is my aphrodisiac.
Angela doesn’t seem to me to have subtleties. She scandalizes
me a bit. Because she’s freer than I.
Our extreme misery.
Wanting to understand is one of the worst things that could
happen to me. But through Angela’s innocence I’m learning not
to know all by myself.
I’m exhausted by Angela. And especially by me. I need to be
alone from myself, so much so that I don’t even rely on God.
And so I’ll leave a page blank or the rest of the book — I’ll
come back when I can.
I’m back. Because the pungency of Angela Pralini called me.
Before her — as before a “masterpiece” — I feel an almost
intolerable tightening in the chest, a desire to flee the emotion.
That’s what I feel with Fellini’s movies.
What our imagination creates resembles the process God has
for creating.
ANGELA: I take refuge in madness because the boring middle
ground of the state of ordinary things is no longer left for me.
I want to see new things — and I’ll only manage to do that if
I lose my fear of madness.
Life is little by little. Today I take half a step, the day after
tomorrow I’ll take another half-step. Such impatience. I want to
swallow life down in a single gulp and then maybe something
like dying. But my own blood is slow.
I want to show myself the dirtiest and lowest part of me —
and only then can I forgive myself. I want to be forgiven for
being so full of sensuality that it is an animal cry inside me, a
taste of the harsh voice of the wolf desiring its prey, me! I
who aspire to the great disorder of vile desires and the
darkness that possesses me in the apocalyptic orgasm of my
existence. My existence is the victim of a fatality. That is: I am,
oh poor me human and weak and needy and begging. I want
your smile, I want your velvet caress, I want the body-to-body
struggle, both so intimate, so gullible lost children.
I cry out for absolution! Oh mighty God, forgive me my life of
errors and the worst habits of feeling, forgive me for existing in
the pleasure so luxuriant and sensual of the absorption of the
miasmas of the body-to-body. I want an abyss for you and to
receive you like a queen of Sheba. Are my desires base? poor
me, for I have an unhappy and unsatisfied body. Oh God of
the desperate, find me, you have the power to distinguish my
small noble part that barely glitters amidst the gravel, find me!
Now! Right away! Ah . . . Ah . . . Ah . . . you found me . .
. How my soul flies, liberated just a moment ago by the
encounter with myself! God FOUND me. HALLELUJAH!
Hallelujah! And I found God in my deepest unconsciousness, in
the sort of coma in which I live I managed to stammer the
vision of the God — in myself! I, also chosen by divine pity.
What glory. Ah, but what glory.
And death no longer has power over me because I AM NO
LONGER AFRAID! I swim and sparkle in states of vibrating
divine fruition. Now I understand: I used to try to open a
path in the darkness, knowing only how to beg. But only when
I became naked did the doors of heaven and perception open
wide to let me pass. I who am such a spark. And so I join
myself to You and punish myself no longer. I bubble so nice
and calm, poor me. This is how it happened: when I saw that
I could no longer bear the weight of myself, I went to bed
and all coiled up as much as possible in the fetal position, this:
reduced to zero, having therefore to surrender to whatever
came to me, since I no longer knew the answer to what I was
asking, I burning with a kind of inner fever. Then — having to
surrender myself to the Nothing — the miracle happened: I
could taste like food in my mouth the flavor of Everything. This
flavor spread like light and the sensation of taste throughout
my entire body, and I surrendered to God, with the delirium of
a soul drinking water.
Ah, how wide is eternity. For that is what I saw: the serene
wideness of eternity, the taste of the eternal. Then the body
once all weak and trembling found the vigor of a newborn in
its first splastic cry in the world of light. And all of me became
strong and roused, like a haughty stalk of blond wheat. Thus,
standing like the stalk of wheat because that’s how it was, with
natural nobility, I could face the grandeur of the God. Standing
like a stalk of wheat, I burst into You and freed myself from
having a distinct soul. I was the general soul of the world. I
was no longer alone: I had found myself in the intimate and
dazzling company of God. Whiteness. Infinite transparency. And
my body radiated in circles of light. Of the light that receives
me. And I, naked as a newborn, returned to God. And this
return of the prodigal son that I was anointed me all over,
anointed the fragile and strong stalk of wheat that I was. And
God was the detector of lost souls. And I who once couldn’t
stand the sensation of the abundance of myself, thinking
fearfully that this encounter was too grandiose and would
annihilate me. Poor me: I addressed myself like a slave
adorned with garlands to please myself as a slave — and
discovered the simplicity and the nudity of a queen, who,
because she has everything, needs nothing more. Bless me,
God: I extend to You a mouth lacerated by the fever of a
long thirst, I extend to You my four paws torn and bleeding
from trying to cling to You. Come and fill me completely with
Your great gentle light, Amen, I owner of nothing, at last,
warmed at last by the breath of an infantile sleep, by the rosy
health of the soul, which emanates from me to myself and
ennobles my way of existing, I, holy vestal, drugged by the
essence of eternity, I protected by the luck of extreme penury
that, because I could no longer stand it, becomes richness. I
no longer need to ask: God gives. I who breathed in my own
nourishing warm breath like a child tucked under sheets and
sheltered from fear. Something touched my shoulder and called
me and I didn’t recognize that it was God and I was afraid of
the great solitude and the great silence that open in the soul
when it is going to receive them. I was afraid of my own
simple grandeur of a human person. I already had and
experienced a bit of all kinds of tortured baseness and human
ambitions — I am now almost free of the “sin” of the soul. I
can finally give myself to the luxury of being free of myself and
start to feel a certain Olympic peace.
Living makes me so nervous, so on the edge of. I take
sedatives just because I’m alive: the sedative partially kills me
and dulls the too-sharp steel of my blade of life. I stop shaking
a bit. And reach a more contemplative stage.
AUTHOR: I think Angela’s pinnacle, one of her climaxes, is this
“mystical” instant. Only Angela will someday know if it was
mystical or mystifying. Anyway, from what it seems, Angela
connected to the existence of a reality of life to which it is
uncommon to adhere because everyday life often kills
transcendence. Reality is fragmentary. Only the reality of the
ultrasonic and ultralight of the infinite is whole.
Perhaps the “union of Angela with Everything!” is no more
than a great self-knowledge and a great acceptance.
ANGELA: I’m still half-submerged in mystical sensations. I
drank a bit too much of that strong beverage, I got a little
drunk. I’ll say nothing about what happened to me, since,
instead of mysticism, they might say it’s mystification. At the
same time that I was receiving the God, I was turned
inside-out and also felt that besides God I myself had made
belief blossom within me coming from my medieval darkness.
And I, trembling flower.
I don’t like to explain myself. I prefer the penumbra of
not-knowing.
I live in provisional ecstasies. I live from the debris of a
shipwreck that the sea rejects upon the sand.
AUTHOR: Everything Angela doesn’t understand she calls God.
She worships the Unknown.
This ecstasy of illumination makes me suspicious. Is it spirit
taking full possession of itself to its very fringes? Or is it a
woman’s body brought to the point of crisis and then of
mirages outside of her but that represent a “throwing away”
for a few instants of the notion of lowness and sin? freed of
the body for finally having acknowledged it, she, free of the
heavy burden of sensuality, accepted the idea of the intimate
union of two bodies — free, the great abundance of the
universe is loosed, universe that has its voice in the absolute
and expansive silence, silence brought to us by the air we
breathe.
This illumination of Angela’s cannot make itself known in
words. As the word “scent” tries to express poorly what we
call “scent.” There are no words pure in themselves. They
always come mixed with: “I don’t know what’s happening to
me.”
I’m starting to think that Angela’s state of grace might be real
because the “illumination” happened right after a feeling of
complete abandonment and suffering. Saint Catherine of Genoa
said that “when God wishes to penetrate a soul, He first
abandons it completely.”
She reached an ecstasy upon losing the illusory multiplicity of
worldly things and starting to feel everything as a whole. It is
something that is nourished in the roots planted in the
darkness of the soul and it rises until it reaches a
“consciousness” that in fact is supernatural light and miracle.
What Angela does not know illuminates her and dominates her
more than what she does know. It’s not a knowledge that has
consequences. In fact she doesn’t even know what to do with
what she knows.
ANGELA: Today I felt something absolutely terrible. I felt that I
am not understood by God.
AUTHOR: He who emphasizes the ritual of faith can lose the
point of faith.
Sometimes those who don’t believe are more likely to receive
like a shining miracle the manna falling from nowhere. This
“nowhere” is the air. And the air is what others call God. I call
God as He wishes to be called. Like this: I open my mouth
and as a means of calling Him let a sound escape me. This
sound is simple. And it involves the vital breath. The sound
limits itself to being only this: Ah . . .
Ah . . . the absolute and good and shrewd indifference . . .
Ah . . . and it’s toward this Ah that we as in a breath go
with our Ah to meet Him.
It’s a matter of the vital breath.
Meditation is an addiction, you acquire the taste.
And the result of meditation is Ah, which makes gods of us.
That’s fine but now tell me what’s the point of being Gods or
Humans?
It seems to please us to be able to say Ah. So I end up shot
through by the voice of God and here I say like one lightly
exhaling: Ah . . .
We were born to enjoy this Ah, could being be enough for
me? I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m talking about.
The plant needs water, light-heat-soil-air to justify being, and
could it be that the Ah justifies us?
There is someone waiting behind our left shoulder to touch us
and to make us say Ah . . .
When I say I love you, I am loving me in you.
I’m not relative I’m infinite that’s why in each being I reflect
myself in each being I encounter myself.
The most perfect thing that exists in the universe is the air.
The air is the God accessible to us. When I speak of things
I’m not reducing life to the material, rather I am humanizing
the inert. All of this is as I once said, I play fair. I’m not
hiding any cards. And if I have any style, let it come and turn
up because I do not seek it.
Every birth presumes a rupture.
I was invited to watch a childbirth but I’m not strong enough
to watch the dramatic birth of the dawn in the mountains
when the sun is aflame.
Every birth is a cruelty. Things that wish to sleep should be
left asleep.
My wickedness comes from the poor accommodation of my
soul in my body. It is squeezed, it lacks inner space.
It’s what didn’t ever let itself be folded into four paws by the
pain of existence, that pain which every once in a while we
must obey in order to keep living our nice middle-class lives.
I ask God: why others? And He answers me: why you? to all
of our questions God responds with a greater question and
that is how we broaden ourselves in spasms for a child within
us to be born. But — but peace on earth and tranquil light in
the air. God who is the nothing-everything sparkles in a gentle
glow of an eternal present, let us therefore sleep until next
week.
And I? Could it be I won’t become my own character? Could
it be I invent myself? All I know about myself is that I’m the
product of a father and a mother. That’s all I know about
creation and life.
We want to penetrate the kingdom of God through sins
because if not for sin there wouldn’t be forgiveness and we
wouldn’t manage to reach Him.
I took refuge in madness because reason was not enough for
me.
I wait for what’s happening. This is my only future and past.
Comfort is an abundance.
One day the comfort in God and no matter how paltry it was
we learn this from being in the warm shelter of our birth.
To be useless is freedom. To have meaning would belittle us,
we are gratuitously just for the pleasure of being.
And from the future we will consciously wait for the lack of
meaning, a freedom in speaking, in feeling Ah . . .
Happiness is nothing more than feeling an Ah with relief, then
let us raise our glasses and modestly toast an Ah to God.
Though it’s hard for me to finish it hurts so much to say
goodbye doesn’t it? Well because in me it hurts Ah.
Why God?
Why not sit smoking and dying of hunger Ah it’s because you
want to be able to say Ah.
Do we exist simply to be relieved?
I pay attention only to pay attention: deep down I don’t want
to know.
I don’t want anything.
God is abstract. That is our tragedy.
I am like the cicadas that explode from so much singing.
When shall I explode? What do I sing? Do I sing the splendor
of dying? Do I sing of my love that is so alive that it
convulses? Do I sing the sorcery in the air? Do I sing the
molecules of the air?
I’m frightened by my own power which however is limboed:
could I kill myself in my desperation for despair? No. I refuse
to kill myself. I want to live until I become an old and
meditative being, comatose from a deep even indescribable and
unreachable lucidity of the senile semi-coma. This senile
semi-coma resembles a numb almost-sleep of the upper layers
of consciousness. In that state — I imagine based on the gazes
I have seen in the gray, immobile old — in that state one can
respond to questions and even conversations: the ultimate aims
of the living man are easy to execute.
What’s difficult and ultimately attainable is the half-unconscious
and present lethargy — without past or future: like for a
morphine addict. It’s a state of unavoidable truth without
words. This state is milky and bluish with flickering ruby-red
splinterings.
I write to you so that beyond the intimate surface on which
we live you might come to know my prolonged howl of a wolf
in the mountains.
I distilled myself entirely: I’m clean like rainwater.
Quint-essence.
Transfiguration.
Let the author beware of popularity, otherwise he will be
defeated by success. There is a time when you must take a
picture of yourself. Hunger is always the same as the first
hunger. The need renews itself empty and entire.
AUTHOR: When something happens I don’t make the most of
it. And then an illogical longing comes. But that’s because the
present time, like the light of a star, only later does it reach
me in light years. While it’s happening I can’t make out what’s
going on. It seems to me that I am only sensitive and alert
when remembering. I almost live, therefore, in the past because
I can’t recognize the type of richness of the present moment.
The forgetting of things is my escape valve. I forget a lot out
of necessity. I’m even trying and succeeding in forgetting me,
me minutes before, I forget my future. I’m naked.
ANGELA: When I ask myself if the future worries me, I reply
astonished or fake: the future? but what future? the future
doesn’t exit. Am I complicated? No, I am simple as Bach!
I fear the instant which is always unique. Today, walking into
the house, I let out a profound sigh as though arriving from a
long and difficult journey. Disappeared people. Where are they
now? When someone finds out call Rádio Tupi. Where is the
disappeared Francisco Paulo Mendes? Is he dead? He
abandoned me, he thought I was really important . . . And the
walls of China? Before I see Christ, I want to see them. I want
a ten-year guarantee. I’m afraid of having a tragic end. I’m
hungry. And so I eat three petals of a yellow rose.
Ah, the intimate life I have with myself isn’t enough for me
because bats and vampires cry out my name: Angela! Angela!
Angela! And I cross measureless spaces to reach the era in
which I live, I who came from afar. There are secret things
that I know how to do. For example: remain seated feeling
Time. Am I in the present? Or am I in the past? And what if
I were in the future? How glorious. Or am I the fragment of a
thing, therefore without time. The meaning of time elapsing is
missing plot and suspense and mystery and climax.
I remember the future. Harmony is foreseeing an instant-now
the next musical phrase. The train of darkness connects
commerce to commerce. Conclave and sponsorship. Oh! the
wonder of mornings. I’ll live until Saturday. And I won’t be
run over. How nice. The world in focus. Does next year exist?
State of emergency?
AUTHOR: I am the prophet of yesterday.
The joy of life is.
ANGELA: Two-twenty a.m. isn’t a time for anything especially
on Saturday.
I shiver thinking in parentheses, oh my God, careful: I’m going
to speak of the year 3000 — help! And the year 40,000? I’m
scared.
In the year 40,000 I’m so dead. Even more than you. Careful,
be very careful, sir. Help, oh inclement blue sky. I said as
calmly as I could: please-help-me. It’s getting dark. And I
without food or drink. I got hysterical, sorry. Am I by chance
inside out? No, God save me. I want to be right-side out, ok?
But it’s so hard.
AUTHOR: You — I say to anyone — you’re to blame for the
ants that will gnaw my mouth ruined by the mechanism of life.
Angela doesn’t die death because she’s already dying in life:
that’s how she escapes a fateful end by having a sample of
total death in her day-to-day life.
And suddenly — suddenly! a demonic and rebellious avalanche
gushes inside me: because I wonder if it’s worth it for Angela
to die. Do I kill her? does she kill herself? I pull back my
reins though the horse complains. Because I just thought better
of it. And I’ll only figure it out after Angela takes a position
regarding death.
Life is so raw and naked that a living dog is worth more than
a dead man. I’m so shaken by this stupid discovery that I light
a candle in memory of that buried man. He was so perfect
that he died.
I always wanted to reach a state of peace and non-struggle. I
thought that was the ideal state. But it so happens that — that
am I really me without my struggle? No, I don’t know how to
have peace.
My question is the size of the Universe. And the only response
that fills in my question is the Universe itself.
But something scares me: that if I search I won’t find.
I discovered a power: the power of being in a locked room: I
imprison myself and become concrete. Though I continue being
an abstraction. It’s not contradictory to make oneself concrete
and abstract: I become concrete on a level that is not that on
which the world is planned. I obtain myself in the concretely
possible that exists within abstraction.
I want to justify death.
Could it be that, after we die, we sometimes wake up startled?
There is a mystery in a cup of water: watching the calm water
I seem to read into it the substance of life. Like a fortune-teller
before her sparkling crystal ball. This story still hasn’t
happened. It will happen in the future. The future is already
with me and it won’t make me out-of-date. Or will it?
I’m an insistent question but I don’t hear an answer. No one’s
ever answered me. I try in vain to find the answer in Angela.
I keep my ears open to hear it. As if my shouted question
would give me more than the echo of the question. I know
that all of life is always nearly a symbol. But my heart wouldn’t
understand. So shall I always miss that thing? Can you live
without that thing? I hardly answer.
I feel an almost insufferable and indescribable beauty. Like a
starry air, like the shapeless shape, like the not-being existing,
like the splendid breathing of an animal. As long as I live I
shall sometimes have the almost-not-a-sensation of what cannot
be named. Between hidden and almost revealed. It’s also a
shimmering desperation and the pain gets confused with beauty
and mixed with an apocalyptic joy.
I’d like to live exclusively from my foolish and fertile meditations
in the contemplation of death and God. I’d like to dedicate
myself to kissing children. Deliver me I beg you all, I no longer
want to be myself, I know that I am no longer myself. I am
you. I feel the need to risk my life. Only then is it worth
living.
— Angela, my love, I fumbled in the darkness of words in
order to find yours. And my hand returned with a word that
dazzled me: scentillating. I don’t know what it means or if
what I discovered exists. Now in the early morning there’s a
clear and delicate silence and the small shadowy garden seems
like that of a cloister. There’s a light inaudible trepidation in the
trees: this trepidation can be heard with the skin of the body.
Angela, as I create you I taste blood in my mouth.
ANGELA: We die.
AUTHOR: Deep down she doesn’t believe that we die.
ANGELA: When I’m really happy I suddenly think that we die.
AUTHOR: But she’s more frightened of life than of death.
ANGELA: Why do I exist? and the answer is: hunger justifies
me.
Ah, that’s it, isn’t it? Well, if that’s how it is then I’ll take
revenge and live my life with brutality, without pity.
AUTHOR: Why do I exist? and the answer is: hunger justifies
me.
I get happy when I feel hunger, as long as there’s something
to eat, of course. Just to have an immediate goal. When I feel
hunger, I have a reason to live. Or I want my life to be
justified by the intense desire to live. What sustains me is
necessity. Necessity makes me create a future. Because desire is
something primitive, serious and something that impels.
ANGELA: I taste like tears.
I’m accompanied by organ and also by a recorder. A spiral
flute. And I am very tango too.
I’m out of tune, what can I do? I was born crooked.
And hungry.
I get the feeling that someone is living my life, that what
happens has nothing to do with me, there’s a mechanical
spring in some part of me.
What I want is simply this: the impossible. To see God. I hear
the noise of the wind in the leaves and answer: yes!
There are so many movements around me that I thought of
them: death awaits me.
My purest movement is that of death.
AUTHOR: Angela already learned to accept her crises of fear:
when they come she immobilizes herself with her eyes closed
and tries to forget herself to the point of becoming an
unfeeling nothing.
I never achieve total immersion. Ah the day I can completely
let myself go — that’s what I’m waiting for. Meanwhile, there’s
Angela impenetrable rock of granite that she is. Or an aerial
fluid I can’t manage to breathe. She’s always tasting a new
fruit with pleasure and without fear of its taste. But she’s
clever: she knows that the only things that are poisonous are
what the birds won’t eat. The new fruit is an apple hidden
and transfigured so as not to frighten and not to leave
paradise. That’s how she tricks her God. In order not to die,
Angela prefers not to exist. I’m creating something that can
only die by being forgotten.
ANGELA: To be happy is a great responsibility. Few have the
nerve. I have the nerve but with a bit of fear. A happy person
is one who has accepted death. When I’m too happy, I feel a
gagging anguish: I get scared.
I get scared easily. I’m afraid to be alive because whoever has
life shall one day die. And the world violates me. The
demanding instincts, the cruel soul, the crudeness of those who
have no decency, the laws to obey, murder — it all makes me
dizzy just as there are people who faint at the sight of blood:
the medical student with a pale face and white lips about to
dissect his first cadaver. It scares me when in a glance I see
the bowels of other people’s spirit. Or when unintentionally I
fall deep into myself and see the interminable abyss of eternity,
abyss through which I phantasmagoric communicate with God.
I fear the natural law that we call God. The fear. Suicides often
kill themselves because they are afraid of death. They can’t
stand the mounting tension of life and the wait for the worst
to happen — and they kill themselves to be free of the threat.
We leave an Alpha for an Omega and destroy ourselves and
work and play and . . . For what? We walk toward a vortex
— irremediably.
Doing nothing might yet be the solution.
They’d confuse that with suicide but it’s mere coincidence. Does
it make sense to run so much after happiness, could it be
enough to be happy? Could it be that being happy is a state
of tolerance?
AUTHOR: I want for my body good clothes, the finest French
food, money to travel, a lover to love freely, a wife to take
care of me. But all that while preserving my monkish soul. I
know that it’s possible. It’s like knowing how to be alone in
the middle of a crowd. It’s like distinguishing your own voice
that would almost get lost in a chorus unison of many voices:
feeling the song in your throat and hearing yourself.
I-must-must hear myself: because I have yet to tell myself
certain things that are mysterious and sacred but with the taste
of blood in my mouth. Things that are difficult to be fully lived
for where is the true center of the pulp of the fruit for me to
bite into? To finally shoot the arrow. But if I don’t hit the
target precisely I shall perish. Because of this fear I don’t dare.
My question is a matter of life and death. To die because of a
word? If that word is filled completely with itself and a source
of dreams — then it’s worth dying for. But everything I do is
out of fear of that word. It’s out of fear that I’m split by a
woman, the one I invented. At the same time I need nothing
— plurified by naked simplicity. Now I’ll let Angela go on
talking about whatever she wants — so that meanwhile I can
retire to my silence. Happy silence. I am a happy man
because I was born. And because I know how to hold my
tongue. To hold your tongue is to be born again.
ANGELA: I no longer know how things understand each other.
Everything seems crazy. Today I took a taxi and my Christ-like
mien made the driver of another taxi look back at me terrified
four times. Oh human face that should be mine and is yours.
I’m still alive though close to death.
AUTHOR: Note: I want to see if I won’t forget to give Angela
a face.
ANGELA: Sometimes I put myself in a situation of seeing just
before really seeing. I foresee the next instant and musically my
breathing accompanies the rhythm of time. I who feel before
feeling. Harmony is sensing the next phrase, the next sound,
the next vision.
AUTHOR: Death is beyond human measure. That’s why I find
it strange. I have no knowledge of its mute language. Or does
it have a language possible for me to understand? It sometimes
seems to me that death is not a fact it’s a sensation that must
already be with me. But I still haven’t reached it.
ANGELA: After I’ve lived will I know I lived. When it’s
happening living escapes me. I am a memory of myself. Only
after “dying” do I see that I lived. I flee from myself.
Sometimes I hurry to finish some intimate episode of life, in
order to capture it in memories, and, more than having lived,
to live. A living that already was. Swallowed by me and now
part of my blood.
AUTHOR: I’m filled with recollections and everything that is
already the past has a touch of aching melancholy.
What do I do with so many memories — but die at last.
ANGELA: My aunt Sinhá died a happy death. She laughed at
the moment she died. You might say she died from laughing.
She simply dribbled around death: she didn’t die at all. She
just passed on to something else forever. She was lucid: like a
lit chandelier, like organ music.
I feel that at this exact moment someone is dying. It disturbs
me, that final breath, and in Ireland a strong redheaded boy is
born. It’s as though they were notifying me. To that robust
child I say good morning.
AUTHOR: When we write or paint or sing we break a law. I
don’t know if it’s the law of the silence that must be kept
before sacrosanct and diabolical things. I don’t know if that’s
the law that is broken.
But if I speak it’s because I no longer have the strength to
remain silent about what we know and what we should keep
secret. But when that silent and magical thing swells too much
we disrespect the law and shout. It’s not a sad cry it’s not a
cry of hallelujah either. I’ve already said this in my book calling
that cry “
it.” Could it be that I already died and didn’t notice?
Could it be that I already no longer exist?
I feel there’s a finger pointing at me and making me live on
the edge of death. Whose finger?
ANGELA: Yes. A bloody finger points at me. I shiver. Could it
be the finger of death? I who survive myself, I queen of
Pharaoh. But what I really like is a soccer tournament. Will I
be alive during the next world cup? I hope not, my God,
death calls out to me, so attractive and lovely. Oh death why
don’t you answer? I call you every day. I was made to die.
The ecstasy of cold champagne. The scientific ecstasy.
As for me, I’m just not up to the present: it’s a bit beyond
me. One could say of me: “she doesn’t know how to take
advantage.” God said to me: come. And I went frozen all over.
The ecstasy of the apocalypse.
But I might never die. I might be eternal and you too, my
love. Will I be eternal after my death? Or am I only
instantaneous?
I am essentially a contradiction.
The serene abstract graphic mark.
Banality as a theme.
Oh how I aspired to a languid life.
Twisted tree: witchcraft.
I feel an absolute anguish as if my arms were opened wide to
the heavens in a receiving gesture and my lips half-open the
better to inhale — as if I longed for the beyond. Beyond me. I
surpass my boundaries and enter the air: the air is my space.
Chaos had happened before and from that chaos emerged the
spectacle.
I deserve a medal for living each day and each night three
hundred and sixty-five days tortured by time. Only death settles
it.
My God, give me the courage to live three hundred and
sixty-five days and nights, all devoid of Thy presence. Give me
the courage to consider that void an abundance. Make me Thy
humble lover, entwined with Thee in ecstasy. Let me speak to
this trembling void and receive in reply the maternal love that
nourishes and cradles. Give me courage to love Thee, without
hating Thy offenses to my soul and to my body. Let my
solitude not destroy me. Let my solitude keep me company.
Give me the courage to face myself. Let me know how to be
left with the nothing and feel nonetheless as if I were filled
with everything. Receive in thy arms my sin of thinking.
I live breathing my last.
Oh get out while you can because at all times the time has
come. Every moment is get-out-while-you-can.
No one rests in the dentist’s chair.
AUTHOR: What mischievous spirits are interfering with Angela’s
mental telephone line? because mentioning the dentist is
something trivial that only a woman could come up with.
Angela is capricious.
ANGELA: It’s all rotten. I feel it in the air and in the people
frightened and starving huddled in a crowd. But I believe that
in the depths of rottenness there exists — green sparkling
redeeming and promised-land — in the depths of the dark
rottenness there shines clear and captivating the Great Emerald.
The Great Pleasure. But why this desire and hunger for
pleasure? Because pleasure is the height of the truthfulness of
a being. It’s the only struggle against death.
As for me, I discovered Death.
But how?! to die without having understood?? But that’s
terrifying! It’s unworthy of the human being not to be able to
understand anything of life. Yes. But mysteriously we go
through the rituals of life. I give my life in homage to whom
or what. I want to dedicate it, like when you dedicate a book.
God doesn’t kill anyone. It’s the person who dies.
Even if someone. Defend my goal, God. I’m imprisoned for
fifteen minutes. What delicious madness to write 13 as a
number and not in words. I’ll wait for you in the other world.
First, though, I kiss my father and my mother. I shall be an
infant rolling in space. Whose satellite? What a chill I suddenly
felt when I said I was no one’s satellite.
I’m serious as hunger. I’m terrified. It’s dawning. I’m dawning.
I’m the chord of a harp. Goal.
I’m serious as hunger. I’m terrified. My heart is in mourning.
But it’s dawning. Our seeds sprout. I’m dawning. I’m not a
judge, no sir. I’m a sweet viola. Better than Carl Orff is silence.
Goal.
What separates me from the world is my future death. Death
will be my greatest individual achievement: a person undresses
herself of herself to die alone of herself. Death is a biblical
demeanor. And it has no discursive history: it is an instant. To
die once and for all. The stopping of the heart takes no time.
It’s the tiniest fraction of a second.
AUTHOR: Angela’s life is continuously at risk. Because I don’t
always have the strength to face her and her challenge. And,
dealing with her, dealing with myself, I almost give in to the
law of easiness. I force myself not to recount the events of
Angela’s life. But I’d fall into the descriptive and the discursive
and that would cause me tedium and downfall.
Angela not only lives without explanation but also acts
inexplicably meanwhile I keep looking at the almost always
immortality of things. A stone seen as stone, that’s when it
becomes stone with its relative eternity. Angela thinks there’s
life after death but she’s unequipped to understand what kind
of strange inaugural life follows with an inimitable simplicity that
life after death. Except life isn’t the life we think we have and
death has another name. There are those who know this
because they saw in a glance their own ignorance of what is
life and death. Those people live in a state of troubled curiosity
while others, thinking that LIFE is their life and death is the
end. And they will never be able to divine another truth.
Without getting into the theory of antimatter in physics,
everything has a front and a back, everything has yes and has
no, light and darkness, flesh and spirit, will we end up in that
antimatter after we die? How can we explain that every born
body has spirit? The unexpected always happens for no one
ever put a soul into the life that is born.
It’s time for consummation.
Living is my code and my enigma. And when I die I shall be
for others a code and an enigma.
Precipices.
I didn’t know that danger is what makes life precious.
Death is the constant danger of life.
Angela’s advantage over me is that she is non-spatial, while I
occupy a place and even after death I shall continue to occupy
the earth.
ANGELA: The future calls me furiously — that is where I’m
going. Disaster? Who knows. When I think that one day I shall
die I double over in laughter. Life is a joke. But everyone
knows my true destination.
I didn’t learn it but I know it.
While I write the irreversible minutes drip. It’s Time passing.
I’m thinking out loud. Who hears me? I look at the person’s
face and see: she’s going to die.
Last night I had a dream within a dream. I dreamed that I
was calmly watching actors working on a stage. And through a
door that was not locked men came in with machine guns and
killed all the actors. I began to cry: I didn’t want them to be
dead. So the actors got up off the ground and said: we aren’t
dead in real life, just as actors, the massacre was part of the
show. Then I dreamed such a good dream: I dreamed this: in
life we are actors in an absurd play written by an absurd God.
We are all participants in this theater: in truth we never shall
die when death happens. We only die as actors. Could that be
eternity?
Who knows, I only know I like diamonds and jade.
Don’t think that I’m writing here my most intimate secret for
there are secrets I never even tell myself. And it’s not only the
final secret that I am not revealing: there are many little
primary secrets that I allow to remain in enigma. I surrender
to the sweet familiarity of eternity. But I don’t know if I
deserve it.
AUTHOR: At the same time she gives herself the luxury of
being sphinxlike. She tells me nothing of her soul. She tells me
nothing of her secret fears. I’m the one who must divine her
and support her like a gentleman. But I can no longer stand it
and one of these days I’ll let out my cry of freedom or make
her kill herself. What I desperately want is to initiate myself in
the fleeting Angela who is always escaping me.
ANGELA: Yesterday the world expelled me from life. Today life
was born. Wind, so much wind. What instability. Me muero. I
live in the future of the wind. Why does everything seem to
say: leave it for next week? I’m here, here waiting. I’m alive
right now and the rest can fuck off. And my dog who didn’t
do anything. He just is. I too am: is. I with my tattered flag.
There are old people who die in the spring, they can’t stand
the bursting of the earth.
I want an elegant death. As a matter of fact I already died
and didn’t hear about it. I am my unnerving ghost.
AUTHOR: I live you as if death had already separated us. So
intense is my longing for you.
Does everything I think about exist? why is my imagination
poor and I only think about realities, and if it doesn’t exist,
then why do I think it?
ANGELA: An anguish. I’d like to live everything at once and
not to keep living bit by bit. But then Death would come.
When I die I won’t know what to do with myself.
There must be a way not to die, it’s just that I haven’t
discovered it. At least not to die in life: to die only after death.
The world’s getting ever more dangerous for me. After dying,
the perilous danger will cease. Breathing is something magical.
I want my end to be as inevitable as death: my end in life will
be possessing. I am virginal.
I almost already know what it will be like after my death. The
empty living room the dog about to die of longing. The
stained-glass windows of my house. Everything empty and calm.
AUTHOR: If they ask me if there’s life for the soul after
death, I answer, mysteriously as I am well aware, why not the
mystery, if the thing really is mysterious — I answer in a
hesitant outline: it exists but it’s not for me to know how that
soul will live. No one has yet discovered the state of things
after death — because it’s impossible to imagine how the God
will behave, the same God who inexplicably for us makes a
seed sprout. I don’t know how the seed sprouts, I don’t know
why this blue sky, I don’t know why this life of mine because
all this happens in a way that my human mind cannot fathom.
I live without a possible explanation. I who have no synonym.
Life, life covered by a veil of melancholy. Death: beacon that
leads me the right way. I feel magnificent and solitary between
life and death.
Everybody knows everything.
Humanity is becoming hard. The facts are becoming bruising.
The morning is a premature flower.
Morning of never again.
One’s incommunicability with oneself is the great vortex of the
nothing. If I don’t find a way to speak to myself the word
suffocates my throat sticking there like an unswallowed stone. I
want to have access to myself whenever I want like someone
opening the doors and going in. I don’t want to be the victim
of liberating chance. I want to have the key to the world
myself and to transpose it like someone transposing himself
from life into death and from death into life.
ANGELA: At the hour of my death — what do I do? Teach
me how to die. I don’t know how.
AUTHOR: I lost the Book of Angela, I don’t know where I left
her life.
ANGELA: A work of art? No, I want the prime thing. I want
the stone that was not sculpted.
I cured myself of death. I never again died.
I see everything as if I had already died and was seeing
everything from afar. Then there comes that sadness of a
cobweb in an abandoned house. What distracts is frothy
hatred. Dry and lashing hatred.
Thinking is so immaterial that it has no words. Never forget,
when you have a pain, that pain will pass: never forget that,
when you die, death will pass. One doesn’t die eternally. It is
just once, and it lasts an instant.
AUTHOR: I still haven’t reached myself. Do Angela’s rags make
her reach herself? My absence from myself hurts me. There
isn’t a single act into which I throw all of myself. And the
grandiosity of life is throwing oneself — throwing oneself even
into death.
“I want to die” with you of love.
So a dreamer I smile: yes, I wanted to die of love with a with
you.
I am looking for somebody whose life I can save. The only
one who allows me to do that is Angela. And as I save her
life, I save my own.
ANGELA: A place in the world is waiting for me to inhabit it.
I was made for no one to need me.
AUTHOR: Somewhere in the world someone is waiting for me.
My face seems to say: my life is not significant.
Only after you die shall I love you completely. I need all your
life for me to love it as if it were mine.
There’s a way of looking that makes you shiver. The forgotten
and Spartan obvious way: the strongest wins.
Angela is stronger than I. I die before she does.
Once there was a man who walked, walked and walked and
stopped and drank cold water from a spring. Then he sat on
a rock and rested his staff. That man was I. And God was at
peace.
ANGELA: It’s dawning: I hear the roosters.
I am dawning.
— The rest is the implicit tragedy of man — mine and yours?
Is solidarity the only way? But “solidarity” I know looks like the
word “solitude.”
[When his eyes withdraw from Angela and she gets smaller
and disappears, then the AUTHOR says:]
— As for me I’m also withdrawing from me. If the voice of
God manifests itself in silence, I too silence myself. Farewell.
I pull back my gaze my camera and Angela starts getting
small, small, smaller — until I lose sight of her.
And now I must interrupt myself because Angela interrupted
life by going into the earth. But not the earth in which one is
buried but the earth in which one is revived. With abundant
rain in the forests and the whisper of the winds.
As for me, I am. Yes.
“I . . . I . . . no. I cannot end.”
I think that . . .
It’s with such profound happiness. Such a hallelujah. Hallelujah,
I shout, hallelujah merging with the darkest human howl of the
pain of separation but a shout of diabolic joy. Because no one
can hold me back now. I can still reason—I studied
mathematics, which is the madness of reason—but now I want
the plasma—I want to eat straight from the placenta. I am a
little scared: scared of surrendering completely because the next
instant is the unknown. The next instant, do I make it? or
does it make itself? We make it together with our breath. And
with the flair of the bullfighter in the ring.
Let me tell you: I’m trying to seize the fourth dimension of
this instant-now so fleeting that it’s already gone because it’s
already become a new instant-now that’s also already gone.
Every thing has an instant in which it is. I want to grab hold
of the is of the thing. These instants passing through the air I
breathe: in fireworks they explode silently in space. I want to
possess the atoms of time. And to capture the present,
forbidden by its very nature: the present slips away and the
instant too, I am this very second forever in the now. Only the
act of love—the limpid star-like abstraction of feeling—captures
the unknown moment, the instant hard as crystal and vibrating
in the air and life is this untellable instant, larger than the
event itself: during love the impersonal jewel of the moment
shines in the air, the strange glory of the body, matter made
feeling in the trembling of the instants—and the feeling is both
immaterial and so objective that it seems to happen outside
your body, sparkling on high, joy, joy is time’s material and
the essence of the instant. And in the instant is the is of the
instant. I want to seize my is
. And like a bird I sing hallelujah
into the air. And my song belongs to no one. But no passion
suffered in pain and love is not followed by a hallelujah.
Is my theme the instant? the theme of my life. I try to keep
up with it, I divide thousands of times into as many times as
the number of instants running by, fragmented as I am and
the moments so fragile—my only vow is to life born with time
and growing along with it: only in time itself is there room
enough for me.
All of me is writing to you and I feel the taste of being and
the taste-of-you is as abstract as the instant. I also use my
whole body when I paint and set the bodiless upon the
canvas, my whole body wrestling with myself. You don’t
understand music: you hear it. So hear me with your whole
body. When you come to read me you will ask why I don’t
keep to painting and my exhibitions, since I write so rough
and disorderly. It’s because now I feel the need for
words—and what I’m writing is new to me because until now
my true word has never been touched. The word is my fourth
dimension.
Today I finished the canvas I told you about: curves that
intersect in fine black lines, and you, with your habit of wanting
to know why— I’m not interested in that, the cause is past
matter—will ask me why the fine black lines? because of the
same secret that now makes me write as if to you, writing
something round and rolled up and warm, but sometimes cold
as the fresh instants, the water of an ever-trembling stream.
Can what I painted on this canvas be put into words? Just as
the silent word can be suggested by a musical sound.
I see that I’ve never told you how I listen to music—I gently
rest my hand on the record player and my hand vibrates,
sending waves through my whole body: and so I listen to the
electricity of the vibrations, the last substratum of reality’s realm,
and the world trembles inside my hands.
And so I realize that I want the vibrating substratum of the
repeated word sung in Gregorian chant. I’m aware that I can’t
say everything I know, I only know when painting or
pronouncing, syllables blind of meaning. And if here I must use
words, they must bear an almost merely bodily meaning. I’m
struggling with the last vibration. To tell you of my substratum
I make a sentence of words made only from instants-now.
Read, therefore, my invention as pure vibration with no
meaning beyond each whistling syllable, read this: “with the
passing of the centuries I lost the secret of Egypt, when I
moved in longitudes, latitudes, and altitudes with the energetic
action of electrons, protons, and neutrons, under the spell of
the word and its shadow.” What I wrote you here is an
electronic drawing without past or future: it is simply now.
I must also write to you because you harvest discursive words
and not the directness of my painting. I know that my phrases
are crude, I write them with too much love, and that love
makes up for their faults, but too much love is bad for the
work. This isn’t a book because this isn’t how anyone writes.
Is what I write a single climax? My days are a single climax: I
live on the edge.
In writing I can’t manufacture something as in painting, when I
use my craft to mix a color. But I’m trying to write to you
with my whole body, loosing an arrow that will sink into the
tender and neuralgic centre of the word. My secret body tells
you: dinosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs, meaning nothing
but their sound, though this doesn’t dry them out like straw
but moistens them instead. I don’t paint ideas, I paint the
unattainable “forever.” Or “for never,” it amounts to the same.
More than anything else, I paint painting. And more than
anything else, I write you hard writing. I want to grab the
word in my hand. Is the word an object? And from the
instants I extract the juice of their fruits. I must deprive myself
to reach the core and seed of life. The instant is living seed.
The secret harmony of disharmony: I don’t want something
already made but something still being tortuously made. My
unbalanced words are the wealth of my silence. I write in
acrobatics and pirouettes in the air—I write because I so deeply
want to speak. Though writing only gives me the full measure
of silence.
And if I say “I” it’s because I dare not say “you,” or “we” or
“one.” I’m forced to the humility of personalizing myself
belittling myself but I am the are-you.
Yes, I want the last word which is also so primary that it gets
tangled up with the unattainable part of the real. I’m still afraid
to move away from logic because I fall into instinct and
directness, and into the future: the invention of today is the
only way to usher in the future. Then it’s the future, and any
hour is your allotted hour. So what’s the harm of moving
away from logic? I deal in raw materials. I’m after whatever is
lurking beyond thought. No use trying to pin me down: I
simply slip away and won’t allow it, no label will stick. I’m
entering a very new and genuine chapter, curious about itself,
so appealing and personal that I can’t paint it or write it. It’s
like moments I had with you, when I would love you,
moments I couldn’t go past because I descended into their
depths. It’s a state of touching the surrounding energy and I
shudder. Some mad, mad harmony. I know that my gaze must
be that of a primitive person surrendered completely to the
world, primitive like the gods who only allow the broad strokes
of good and evil and don’t want to know about good tangled
up like hair in evil, evil that is good.
I pin down sudden instants that carry within them their own
death and others are born—I pin down the instants of
metamorphosis and there’s a terrible beauty to their sequence
and concurrence.
Now day is breaking, a dawn of white mist on the sands of
the beach. Everything is mine, then. I barely touch food, I
don’t want to awaken beyond the day’s awakening. I’m
growing with the day that as it grows kills in me a certain
vague hope and forces me to look the hard sun straight in the
face. The gale blows and scatters my papers. I hear that wind
of cries, the death rattle of a bird open in oblique flight. And I
here impose upon myself the severity of a taut language, I
impose upon myself the nakedness of a white skeleton free of
humours. But the skeleton is free of life and while I live I
shudder all over. I won’t reach the final nakedness. And I still
don’t want it, apparently.
This is life seen by life. I may not have meaning but it is the
same lack of meaning that the pulsing vein has.
I want to write to you like someone learning. I photograph
each instant. I deepen the words as if I were painting, more
than an object, its shadow. I don’t want to ask why, you can
always ask why and always get no answer—could I manage to
surrender to the expectant silence that follows a question
without an answer? Though I sense that some place or time
the great answer for me does exist.
And then I shall know how to paint and write, after the
strange but intimate answer. Listen to me, listen to the silence.
What I say to you is never what I say to you but something
else instead. It captures the thing that escapes me and yet I
live from it and am above a shining darkness. One instant
leads me numbly to the next and the athematic theme unfurls
without a plan but geometric like the successive shapes in a
kaleidoscope.
I slowly enter my gift to myself, splendor ripped open by the
final song that seems to be the first. I enter the writing slowly
as I once entered painting. It is a world tangled up in
creepers, syllables, woodbine, colors and words—threshold of an
ancestral cavern that is the womb of the world and from it I
shall be born.
And if I often paint caves that is because they are my plunge
into the earth, dark but haloed with brightness, and I, blood of
nature— extravagant and dangerous caves, talisman of the
Earth, where stalactites, fossils and rocks come together, and
where the animals mad by their own malign nature seek
refuge. The caves are my hell. Forever dreaming cave with its
fogs, memory or longing? eerie, eerie, esoteric, greenish with
the slime of time. Inside the dark cave glimmer the hanging
rats with the cruciform wings of bats. I see downy and black
spiders. Mice and rats run frightened along the ground and up
the walls. Between the rocks the scorpion. Crabs, just like
themselves since prehistory, through deaths and births, would
look like threatening beasts if they were the size of a man. Old
cockroaches crawl in the murky light. And all of this is me. All
is weighted with sleep when I paint a cave or write to you
about it—from outside it comes the clatter of dozens of wild
horses stamping with dry hoofs the darkness, and from the
friction of the hoofs the rejoicing is freed in sparks: here I am,
I and the cave, in the very time that will rot us.
I want to put into words but without description the existence
of the cave that some time ago I painted—and I don’t know
how. Only by repeating its sweet horror, cavern of terror and
wonders, place of afflicted souls, winter and hell, unpredictable
substratum of the evil that is inside an earth that is not fertile.
I call the cave by its name and it begins to live with its
miasma. I then fear myself who knows how to paint the
horror, I, creature of echoing caverns that I am, and I
suffocate because I am word and also its echo.
But the instant-now is a firefly that sparks and goes out,
sparks and goes out. The present is the instant in which the
wheel of the speeding car just barely touches the ground. And
the part of the wheel that still hasn’t touched, will touch in that
immediacy that absorbs the present instant and turns it into
the past. I, alive and glimmering like the instants, spark and go
out, alight and go out, spark and go out. It’s just that
whatever I capture in me has, when it’s now being transposed
into writing, the despair that words take up more instants than
the flash of a glance. More than the instant, I want its flow.
A new era, this my own, and it announces me right away. Am
I brave enough? For now I am: because I come from the
suffering afar, I come from the hell of love but now I am free
of you. I come from afar—from a weighty ancestry. I who
come from the pain of living. And I no longer want it. I want
the vibration of happiness. I want the impartiality of Mozart.
But I also want inconsistency. Freedom? it’s my final refuge, I
forced myself to freedom and I bear it not like a talent but
with heroism: I’m heroically free. And I want the flow.
What I write to you is not comfortable. I don’t impart
confidences. Instead I metallize myself. And I’m not comfortable
for you and for me; my word bursts into the space of the
day. What you will know of me is the shadow of the arrow
that has hit its target. I shall only vainly grasp a shadow that
takes up no room in space, and what barely matters is the
dart. I construct something free of me and of you—this is my
freedom that leads to death.
In this instant-now I’m enveloped by a wandering diffuse desire
for marvelling and millions of reflections of the sun in the
water that runs from the faucet onto the lawn of a garden all
ripe with perfumes, garden and shadows that I invent right
here and now and that are the concrete means of speaking in
this my instant of life. My state is that of a garden with
running water. In describing it I try to mix words that time
can make itself. What I tell you should be read quickly like
when you look.
Now it’s day and suddenly again Sunday in an unexpected
eruption. Sunday is a day of echoes—hot, dry, and everywhere
buzzings of bees and wasps, cries of birds and the distance of
paced hammer blows—where do the echoes of Sunday come
from? I who loathe Sunday because it’s hollow. I, who want
the most primary thing because it’s the source of generation—I
who long to drink water at the source of the spring—I who
am all of this, must by fate and tragic destiny only know and
taste the echoes of me, because I cannot capture the me itself.
I am in a stupefying, trembling, marvel expectation, my back
turned to the world, and somewhere the innocent squirrel
escapes. Plants, plants. I snooze in the summer heat of the
Sunday that has flies circling the sugar-bowl. A boast of colors,
that of Sunday, and ripe splendor. And all this I painted some
time ago and on another Sunday. And here is that once-virgin
canvas, now covered by ripe colors. Bluebottle flies glitter in
front of my window open to the air of the torpid street. The
day seems like the smooth stretched skin of a fruit that in a
small catastrophe the teeth tear, its liquor drains. I’m afraid of
the accursed Sunday that liquidifies me.
To remake myself and remake you I return to my state of
garden and shadow, cool reality, I barely exist and if I exist it’s
with delicate caution. Around the shadow is a heat of abundant
sweat. I’m alive. But I feel that I have yet to reach my limits,
borders with what? without borders, the adventure of
dangerous freedom. But I take risks, I live taking risks. I’m full
of acacias swaying yellow, and I who have barely started my
journey, I start it with a sense of tragedy, guessing toward
which lost ocean my steps of life are leading. And madly I take
control of the recesses of myself, my ravings suffocate me with
so much beauty. I am before, I am almost, I am never. And
all of this I won when I stopped loving you.
I write to you as an exercise in sketching before painting. I see
words. What I say is pure present and this book is a straight
line in space. It’s always current, and a camera’s photometer
opens and immediately closes, but keeping within it the flash.
Even if I say “I lived” or “I shall live” it’s present because I’m
saying them now.
I also started these pages with the goal of preparing myself for
painting. But now I’m overwhelmed by the taste of words, and
almost free myself from the dominion of paint; I feel a
voluptuousness in going along creating something to tell you.
I’m living the initiation ceremony of the word and my gestures
are hieratic and triangular.
Yes, this is life seen by life. But suddenly I forget how to
capture whatever is happening, I don’t know how to capture
whatever exists except by living here each thing that arises and
no matter what it is: I am almost free of my errors. I let the
free horse run fiery. I, who trot nervously and only reality
delimits me.
And when the day reaches its end I hear the crickets and
become entirely replete and unintelligible. Then I live the blue
daybreak that comes with its bulge full of little birds—I wonder
if I’m giving you an idea of what a person goes through in
life? And every thing that occurs to me I note to pin it down.
For I want to feel in my hands the quivering and lively nerve
of the now and may that nerve resist me like a restless vein.
And may it rebel, that nerve of life, and may it contort and
throb. And may sapphires, amethysts and emeralds spill into
the dark eroticism of abundant life: because in my darkness
quakes at last the great topaz, word that has its own light.
I am now listening to a sylvan music, almost just drumming
and rhythm that comes from a neighboring house where
young junkies live the present. Another instant of incessant,
incessant rhythm, and something terrible happens to me.
It’s that I shall pass because of the rhythm into its
paroxysm—I shall pass to the other side of life. How can I tell
you this? It’s terrible and threatens me. I feel that I can no
longer stop and I’m scared. I try to distract myself from the
fear. But the real hammering stopped long ago: I’m being the
incessant hammering in me. From which I must free myself.
But I can’t: the other side of me calls me. The footsteps I
hear are my own.
As if ripping from the depths of the earth the knotted roots of
a rare tree, that’s how I write to you, and those roots as if
they were powerful tentacles like voluminous naked bodies of
strong women entwined by serpents and by carnal desires for
fulfilment, and all this is the prayer of a black mass, and a
creeping plea for amen: because the bad is unprotected and
needs the approval of God: that is creation.
Could I have gone without feeling it to the other side? The
other side is a throbbingly hellish life. But there is the
transfiguration of my terror: so I give myself over to a heavy
life all in symbols heavy as ripe fruits. I choose mistaken
resemblances but that drag me through the tangle. A trace
memory of the common sense of my past keeps me brushing
against this side here. Help me because something is coming
toward me and laughing at me. Quick, save me.
But no one can give me their hand to help me out: I must
use great strength—and in the nightmare, with a sudden
wrench, I finally fall face-down on this side here. I let myself lie
tossed upon the rustic earth, exhausted, heart still beating
madly, breathing in great retchings. Am I safe? I wipe my
damp brow. I get up slowly, try to take the first steps of a
weak convalescence. I’m managing to get my balance.
No, all this isn’t happening in real facts but in the domain
of—of an art? yes, of an artifice through which a most delicate
reality arises which comes to exist in me: the transfiguration
happened to me.
But the other side, from which I barely escaped, became
sacred and I confide my secret to no one. It seems to me
that in a dream I swore a pledge on the other side, a blood
oath. No one will know anything: what I know is so volatile
and nearly inexistent that it is between me and I.
Am I one of the weak? a weak woman possessed by incessant
and mad rhythm? if I were solid and strong would I even
have heard the rhythm? I find no answer: I am. This is all
that comes to me from life. But what am I? the answer is
just: what am I. Though I sometimes scream: I no longer
want to be I! but I stick to myself and inextricably there forms
a tessitura of life.
May whoever comes along with me come along: the journey is
long, it is tough, but lived. Because now I am speaking to you
seriously: I am not playing with words. I incarnate myself in
the voluptuous and unintelligible phrases that tangle up beyond
the words. And a silence rises subtly from the knock of the
phrases.
So writing is the method of using the word as bait: the word
fishing for whatever is not word. When this non-word—between
the lines— takes the bait, something has been written. Once
whatever is between the lines is caught, the word can be
tossed away in relief. But that’s where the analogy ends: the
non-word, taking the bait, incorporates it. So what saves you is
writing absentmindedly.
I don’t want to have the terrible limitation of those who live
merely from what can make sense. Not I: I want an invented
truth.
What shall I tell you? I shall tell you the instants. I go too far
and only then do I exist and in a feverish way. What a
fever—will I one day manage to stop living? woe is me, who
dies so much. I follow the tortuous path of roots bursting the
earth, I have a gift for passion, in the bonfire of a dry trunk I
contort in the blaze. To the span of my existence I give an
occult meaning that goes beyond me. I’m a concomitant being:
I gather in me time past, the present and the future, the time
that pulses in the tick-tock of the clocks.
To interpret myself and formulate me I need new signs and
new articulations in shapes found on this side and beyond my
human story. I transfigure reality and then another dreaming
and sleepwalking reality, creates me. And all of me rolls and as
I roll on the ground I add to myself in leaves, I, anonymous
work of an anonymous reality only justifiable as long as my life
lasts. And then? then all that I lived will be a poor superfluity.
But for the time being I am in the centre of everything that
screams and teems. And it’s subtle as the most intangible
reality. For now time is the duration of a thought.
This contact with the invisible nucleus of reality is of such
purity.
I know what I am doing here: I am telling of the instants that
drip and are thick with blood.
I know what I am doing here: I’m improvising. But what’s
wrong with that? improvising as in jazz they improvise music,
jazz in fury, improvising in front of the crowd.
It’s so odd to have exchanged my paints for this strange thing
that is the word. Words—I move cautiously among them as
they can turn threatening; I can have the freedom to write
this: “pilgrims, merchants and shepherds led their caravans
toward Tibet and the roads were difficult and primitive.” With
that phrase I made a scene be born, as in a photographic
flash.
What does this jazz that is improvisation say? it says arms
tangled with legs and the flames rising and I passive like meat
that is devoured by the sharp hook of an eagle that interrupts
its blind flight. I express to me and to you my most hidden
desires and achieve an orgiastic confused beauty. I tremble with
pleasure amidst the novelty of using words that form an
intense thicket. I struggle to conquer more deeply my freedom
of sensations and thoughts, without any utilitarian meaning: I
am alone, I and my freedom. Such is my freedom that it
could scandalize a primitive but I know that you are not
scandalized by the fullness I achieve and that is without
perceptible borders. This capacity of mine to live whatever is
rounded and ample —I surround myself with carnivorous plants
and legendary animals, all bathed in the coarse and twisted
oblique light of a mythical sex. I proceed in an intuitive way
and without seeking an idea: I am organic. And I don’t
question myself about my motives. I plunge into the almost
pain of an intense happiness— and to adorn me leaves and
branches spring up in my hair.
I don’t know what I’m writing about: I am obscure to myself.
I only had initially a lunar and lucid vision, and so I plucked
for myself the instant before it died and perpetually dies. This
is not a message of ideas that I am transmitting to you but an
instinctive ecstasy of whatever is hidden in nature and that I
foretell. And this is a feast of words. I write in signs that are
more a gesture than voice. All this is what I got used to
painting, delving into the intimate nature of things. But now the
time to stop painting has come in order to remake myself, I
remake myself in these lines. I have a voice. As I throw myself
into the line of my drawing, this is an exercise in life without
planning. The world has no visible order and all I have is the
order of my breath. I let myself happen.
I am inside the great dreams of the night: for the right-now is
by night. And I sing the passage of time: I am still the queen
of the Medes and of the Persians and am also my slow
evolution that throws itself like a drawbridge into a future
whose milky fogs I already breathe today. My aura is mystery
of life. I surpass myself abdicating myself and am therefore the
world: I follow the voice of the world, I myself suddenly with a
unique voice.
The world: a tangle of bristling telephone wires. And the
brightness however is still dark: that is I facing the world.
A dangerous balance, mine, mortal danger for the soul. The
night of today looks at me with torpor, verdigris and lime. I
want inside this night that is longer than life, I want, inside this
night, life raw and bloody and full of saliva. I want this word:
splendidness, splendidness is the fruit in its succulence, fruit
without sadness. I want distances. My wild intuition about
myself. But my main thing is always hidden. I am implicit. And
when I make myself explicit I lose the humid intimacy.
What color is the spatial infinity? it is the color of air.
We—faced with the scandal of death.
Listen only superficially to what I say and from the lack of
meaning a meaning will be born as from me a high and light
life is inexplicably born. The dense jungle of words thickly
envelops what I feel and live, and transforms everything I am
into some thing of mine that remains outside me. Nature is
enveloping: it entangles me entirely and is sexually alive, just
that: alive. I too am ferociously alive—and I lick my snout like
a tiger who has just devoured a deer.
I write to you now, at the very moment itself. I unfold only in
the now. I speak today—not yesterday or tomorrow—but today
and at this actual perishable instant. My small and boxed-in
freedom joins me to the freedom of the world—but what is a
window if not the air framed by right angles? I am rudely
alive. I am leaving—says death without adding that he’s taking
me along. And I shiver in panting breath because I must go
with him. I am death. Death takes place in my very
being—how can I explain to you? It’s a sensual death. Like a
dead person I walk through the high grass in the greenish
light of its blades: I am Diana the Huntress of gold and all I
can find are heaps of bones. I live from an underlying layer of
feelings: I am barely alive.
But these high summer days of damnation whisper to me the
need for renunciation. I renounce having a meaning, and then
the sweet and painful weakness grips me. Round and round
shapes cross in the air. It’s a summer heat. I navigate in my
galley that braves the winds of a bewitched summer. Crushed
leaves remind me of the ground of my childhood. The green
hand and the golden breasts—that is how I paint the mark of
Satan. They who fear us and our alchemy stripped witches and
sorcerers in search of the hidden mark that was almost always
found though it could only be known on sight for that mark
was indescribable and unpronounceable even in the darkness of
the Middle Ages— Middle Ages, thou art my dark subjacency
and in the glare of the bonfires the marked ones dance in
circles riding branches and foliage which are the phallic symbol
of fertility: even in the white mass blood is used and there it
is drunk.
Listen: I let you be, therefore let me be.
But eternally is a very hard word: it has a granitic “t” in the
middle. Eternity: for everything that is never began. My small
ever so limited head bursts when thinking about something that
doesn’t begin and doesn’t end—for that is the eternal.
Fortunately that feeling doesn’t last long because I can’t bear it
to stay and if it did it would lead to madness. But my head
also bursts when imagining the opposite: something that has
begun—because where would it begin? And that has
ended—but what comes after ending? As you see, it’s
impossible for me to deepen and take possession of life, which
is aerial, is my light breath. But I do know what I want here:
I want the inconclusive. I want the profound organic disorder
that nevertheless hints at an underlying order. The great
potency of potentiality. These babbled phrases of mine are
made the very moment they’re being written and are so new
and green they crackle. They are the now. I want the
experience of a lack of construction. Though this text of mine
is crossed from end to end by a fragile connecting
thread—which? that of a plunge into the matter of the word?
of passion? A lustful thread, breath that heats the passing of
syllables. Life really just barely escapes me though the certainty
comes to me that life is other and has a hidden style.
This text that I give you is not to be seen close up: it gains
its secret previously invisible roundness when seen from a
high-flying plane. Then you can divine the play of islands and
see the channels and seas. Understand me: I write you an
onomatopoeia, convulsion of language. I’m not transmitting to
you a story but just words that live from sound. I speak to
you thus:
“Lustful trunk.”
And I bathe within it. It is linked to the root that penetrates
inside us into the earth. All that I write you is taut. I use stray
words that are in themselves a free dart: savages, barbarians,
decadent noblemen and gangsters. Does that mean anything to
you? It speaks to me.
But the most important word in the language has but two
letters: is. Is.
I am at its core.
I still am.
I am at the living and soft centre.
Still.
It sparkles and is elastic. Like the gait of a glossy black
panther that I saw and that walked softly, slowly and
dangerously. But not caged—because I don’t want that. As for
the unforeseeable—the next phrase is unforeseeable to me. In
the core where I am, in the core of the Is, I ask no questions.
Because when it is—it is. I am only limited by my identity. I,
elastic being and separated from other bodies.
In truth I’m still not quite seeing properly the thread of what
I’m writing you. I think I never shall—but I acknowledge the
dark in which the two eyes of the soft panther shine. Darkness
is my hothouse. Enchanted darkness. I’ll keep talking to you
and taking the risk of disconnection: I am subterraneously
unreachable by my knowledge.
I write to you because I don’t understand myself.
But I’ll keep following myself. Elastic. This forest where I
survive in order to be is such a mystery. But now I think
things are happening. That is: I’m going in. I mean: into the
mystery. I myself mysterious and inside the core in which I
move swimming, protozoan. One day I childishly said: I can do
everything. It was the pre-viewing of one day being able to
cast myself off and fall into the abandon of every law. Elastic.
The profound joy: the secret ecstasy. I know how to invent a
thought. I feel the commotion of novelty. But I am well aware
that what I write is only a tone.
In my core I have the strange impression that I don’t belong
to the human species.
There is much to say that I don’t know how to say. The
words are lacking. But I refuse to invent new ones: those that
already exist must say what can be said and what is forbidden.
And I can sense whatever is forbidden. If I have the strength.
Beyond thought there are no words: it is itself. My painting
has no words: it is beyond thought. In this land of the is-itself
I am pure crystalline ecstasy. It is itself. I am myself. You are
yourself.
And I am haunted by my ghosts, by all that is mythic,
fantastic and gigantic: life is supernatural. I walk holding an
open umbrella upon a tightrope. I walk to the limit of my
great dream. I see the fury of the visceral impulses: tortured
viscera guide me. I don’t like what I just wrote— but I’m
duty-bound to accept the whole section because it happened to
me. And I have much respect for what I happen to myself.
My essence is unconscious of itself and that’s why I obey
myself blindly.
I’m being antimelodic. I take pleasure in the difficult harmony
of the harsh opposites. Where am I going? and the answer is:
I’m going.
And so when I die, I’ll never have been born and lived: death
washes away the traces of the sea-foam on the beach.
Now it is an instant.
Here is another now.
And another. My effort: to bring now the future to here. I
move inside my deep instincts which carry themselves out
blindly. I feel then that I’m near springs, pools and waterfalls,
all with abundant waters. And I free.
Hear me, hear my silence. What I say is never what I say but
instead something else. When I say “abundant waters” I’m
speaking of the force of body in the waters of the world. It
captures that other thing that I’m really saying because I myself
cannot. Read the energy that is in my silence. Ah I fear God
and his silence.
I’m myself.
But there’s also the mystery of the impersonal that is the “it”:
I have the impersonal inside me and isn’t something the
personal that sometimes floods me can corrupt or rot by the
personal that sometimes floods me: but I dry myself in the sun
and am an impersonal of the dry and germinative pit of a
fruit. My personal is humus in the earth and lives from rotting.
My “it” is hard like a pebble.
The transcendence inside me is the living and soft “it” and has
the thought that an oyster has. Could the oyster when torn
from its root feel anxiety? It is disturbed in its life without eyes.
I used to drip lemon juice onto the living oyster and watched
in horror and fascination as it contorted all over. And I was
eating the living it
. The living it is the God.
I’ll stop for a bit because I know that the God is the world.
He is whatever exists. I pray to whatever exists? It’s not
dangerous to approach whatever exists. Profound prayer is a
meditation upon the nothing. It’s the dry and electrical contact
with oneself, an impersonal oneself.
I don’t like when they drip lemon upon my depths and make
me contort all over. Are the facts of life lemon on the oyster?
Does the oyster sleep?
What is the first element? immediately there must have been
two to have the secret intimate movement from which milk
gushes.
I have been told that the cat after giving birth eats her own
placenta and for four days eats nothing else. Only then does
she drink milk. Let me speak strictly of breast-feeding. People
talk about the milk rising. How? And it wouldn’t help to explain
because the explanation demands another explanation which
would demand another explanation and which would open
again onto the mystery. But I know it things about
breast-feeding a child.
I am breathing. Up and down. Up and down. How does the
naked oyster breathe? If it breathes I can’t see it. Does what I
cannot see not exist? What moves me the most is that what I
cannot see nonetheless exists. For then I have at my feet a
whole unknown world that exists entire and full of rich saliva.
The truth is somewhere: but no use thinking. I shall not
discover it and yet I live from it.
What I write to you does not come gently, slowly rising to a
peak before dying away gently. No: what I write you is aflame
like fiery eyes.
Tonight the moon is full. Through the window the moon
covers my bed and turns everything a milky bluish white. The
moon is gauche. It’s to your left as you go in. So I escape by
closing my eyes. Because the full moon is light insomnia: numb
and drowsy like after love. And I had decided to go to sleep
so I could dream, I was missing the news that comes in the
dream.
So I dreamed something I’ll try to reproduce. It was about a
film I was watching. There was a man imitating a movie star.
And everything this man did was in turn imitated by others
and others. The slightest gesture. And there was the advert for
a drink called Zerbino. The man took the bottle of Zerbino and
lifted it to his lips. So everyone took a bottle of Zerbino and
lifted it to their lips. In the centre the man who was imitating
a movie star said: this is a film advertising Zerbino and
Zerbino is actually rubbish. But that wasn’t the end. The man
picked up the drink again and drank. And so did the others:
it was inevitable. Zerbino was an institution stronger than the
man. The women at this point looked like stewardesses.
Stewardesses are dehydrated—a lot of water needs to be added
to their powder to turn them into milk. It’s a film about
automatic people who are acutely and gravely aware that they
are automatic and that there’s no escape. The God is not
automatic: for Him every instant is. He is it.
But there are questions I asked myself as a child and that
were never answered, they still echo mournfully: did the world
make itself? But where did it make itself? in what place? And
if it was by the energy of God —how did it begin? could it be
like now when I am being and at the same time making
myself? It’s because of the absence of an answer that I get so
bothered.
But 9 and 7 and 8 are my secret numbers. I am an initiate
without a sect. Avid for the mystery. My passion for the crux
of numbers, in which I divine the core of their own rigid and
fatal destiny. And I dream of luxuriant grandeurs deepened in
the darkness: whirl of abundance, where the velvety and
carnivorous plants are we who have just sprouted, sharp love—
slow faint.
Could it be that what I am writing to you is beyond thought?
Reasoning is what it is not. Whoever can stop reasoning—which
is terribly difficult—let them come along with me. But at least
I’m not imitating a movie star and nobody needs to lift me to
their lips or become a stewardess.
I’ve got a confession to make: I’m a little frightened. For I
don’t know where my freedom will lead me. It is neither
arbitrary nor libertine. But I am unbound.
Every once in a while I’ll give you a light story— melodic and
cantabile area to break up this string quartet of mine: a
figurative interval to open a clearing in my nourishing jungle.
Am I free? There is some thing still holding me. Or am I
holding it? It’s also this: I’m not entirely unbound because I
am in union with everything. Moreover one person is
everything. It’s not heavy to carry because it simply isn’t
carried: it is everything.
It seems to me that for the first time I’m knowing about
things. My impression is that I only don’t go more toward
things to not surpass myself. I have a certain fear of myself,
I’m not to be trusted and mistrust my false power.
This is the word of someone who cannot.
I direct nothing. Not even my own words. But it’s not sad: it’s
happy humility. I, who live sideways, am to your left as you
come in. And the world trembles within me.
Is this word to you promiscuous? I would like it not to be, I
am not promiscuous. But I am kaleidoscopic: I’m fascinated by
my sparkling mutations that I here kaleidoscopically record.
Now I am going to stop for a while to deepen myself more.
Then I’ll be back.
I’m back. I was existing. I received a letter from São Paulo
from a person I don’t know. A final suicide note. I called São
Paulo. No one answered, it rang and rang and echoed as if in
a silent apartment. Did he die or not die. This morning I called
again: still no answer. He died, yes. I’ll never forget.
I’m no longer frightened. Let me talk, all right? I was born like
this: drawing from my mother’s uterus the life that was always
eternal. Wait for me—all right? When I paint or write I’m
anonymous. My profound anonymity which no one ever
touched.
I have an important thing to tell you. Because I’m not joking:
it is the pure element. Material of the instant of time. I am not
objectivizing anything: I am having the real birth of it
. I feel
faint like someone about to be born.
To be born: I’ve watched a cat give birth. The kitten emerges
wrapped in a sack of fluid and all huddled inside. The mother
licks the sack of fluid so many times that it finally breaks and
there a kitten almost free, only attached by its umbilical cord.
Then the mother-creator-cat breaks that cord with her teeth
and another fact appears in the world. That process is it
. I
am not joking. I am earnest. Because I am free. I am so
simple.
I am giving freedom to you. First I rip the sack of fluid. Then
I cut the umbilical cord. And you are alive on your own
account.
And when I am born, I become free. That is the foundation of
my tragedy.
No. It’s not easy. But it “is.” I ate my own placenta so as not
to have to eat for four days. To have milk to give you. Milk is
a “this.” And no one is I. No one is you. That is what solitude
is.
I’m waiting for the next phrase. It’s a matter of seconds.
Speaking of seconds I ask if you can stand for time to be
today and now and right away. I can stand it because I ate
my own placenta.
At half past three in the morning I woke up. And immediately
elastic I jumped out of bed. I came to write you. I mean: be.
Now it’s half past five. I want nothing: I am pure. I don’t wish
this solitude on you. But I myself am in the creating fog. Lucid
darkness, luminous stupidity.
There is much I cannot tell you. I am not going to be
autobiographical. I want to be “bio.”
I write with the flow of the words.
Before the appearance of the mirror, the person didn’t know
his own face except reflected in the waters of a lake. After a
certain point everyone is responsible for the face he has. I’ll
now look at mine. It is a naked face. And when I think that
no other like it exists in the world, I get a happy shock. Nor
will there ever be. Never is the impossible. I like never. I also
like ever. What is there between never and ever that links
them so indirectly and intimately?
At the bottom of everything there is the hallelujah.
This instant is. You who read me are.
I find it hard to believe that I shall die. Because I’m bubbling
in cold freshness. My life will be very long because each instant
is. I get the feeling I’m about to be born and can’t.
I am a heart beating in the world.
You who are reading me please help me to be born.
Wait: it’s getting dark. Darker.
And darker.
The instant is of total darkness.
It goes on.
Wait: I begin to glimpse a thing. A luminescent shape. A milky
belly with a navel? Wait—because I shall emerge from this
darkness where I am afraid, darkness and ecstasy. I am the
heart of the shadow.
The problem is that the curtain over the window of my room
is defective. It is stuck and so it doesn’t close. So the whole
full moon enters and phosphoresces the room with silences: it’s
horrible.
Now the shadows are retreating.
I was born.
Pause.
Marvelous scandal: I am born.
My eyes are shut. I am pure unconsciousness. They already
cut the umbilical cord: I am unattached in the universe. I don’t
think but feel the it
. With my eyes I blindly seek the breast: I
want thick milk. No one taught me to want. But I already
want. I’m lying with my eyes open looking at the ceiling. Inside
is the darkness. An I that pulses already forms. There are
sunflowers. There is tall wheat. I is.
I hear the hollow boom of time. It’s the world deafly forming.
If I can hear that is because I exist before the formation of
time. “I am” is the world. World without time. My
consciousness now is light and it is air. Air has neither place
nor time. Air is the non-place where everything will exist. What
I am writing is the music of the air. The formation of the
world. Slowly what will be approaches. What will be already is.
The future is ahead and behind and to either side. The future
is what always existed and always will exist. Even if Time is
abolished? What I’m writing to you is not for reading— it’s for
being. The trumpets of the angel-beings echo in the without
time. The first flower is born in the air. The ground that is
earth forms. The rest is air and the rest is slow fire in
perpetual mutation. Does the word “perpetual” not exist
because time does not exist? But the boom exists. And this
existence of mine starts to exist. Is that time starting?
It suddenly occurred to me that you don’t need order to live.
There is no pattern to follow and the pattern itself doesn’t
even exist: I am born.
I’m still not ready to talk about “he” or “she.” I demonstrate
“that.” That is universal law. Birth and death. Birth. Death.
Birth and—like a breathing of the world.
I am pure it that was pulsing rhythmically. But I can feel that
soon I shall be ready to talk about he or she. I’m not
promising you a story here. But there’s it
. Bearable? It is soft
and is oyster and is placenta. I am not joking because I am
not a synonym—I am the name itself. There is a thread of
steel going through all that I am writing you. There’s the
future. Which is today.
My vast night goes by in the primary of a latency. The hand
touches the earth and listens hotly to a heart pulsing. I see the
great white slug with a woman’s breasts: is that a human
entity? I burn it in an inquisitorial bonfire. I have the mysticism
of the darkness of a remote past. And I emerge from these
victims’ tortures with the indescribable mark that symbolizes life.
Elemental creatures, dwarves, gnomes, goblins and sprites
surround me. I sacrifice animals to collect the blood I need for
my witching ceremonies. In my fury I offer up my soul in its
own blackness. The mass frightens me—me who carries it out.
And the clouded mind dominates matter. The beast bares its
teeth and in the distance of the air gallop the horses of the
carnival floats.
In my night I idolise the secret meaning of the world. Mouth
and tongue. And a horse free with loosed strength. I keep its
hoof in amorous fetishism. In my deep night a mad wind
blows that brings me scraps of screams.
I am feeling the martyrdom of an untimely sensuality. In the
early hours I awake full of fruit. Who will come to gather the
fruit of my life? If not you and I myself? Why is it that things
an instant before they happen already seem to have happened?
It’s because of the simultaneity of time. And so I ask you
questions and these will be many. Because I am a question.
And in my night I feel the evil that rules me. What is called a
beautiful landscape causes me nothing but fatigue. What I like
are landscapes of dry and baked earth, with contorted trees
and mountains made of rock and with a whitish and
suspended light. There, yes, a hidden beauty lies. I know that
you don’t like art either. I was born hard, heroic, alone, and
standing. And I found my counterpoint in the landscape
without picturesqueness and without beauty. Ugliness is my
banner of war. I love the ugly with the love of equals. And I
defy death. I—I am my own death. And no one goes further.
The barbarian within me seeks the cruel barbarian outside me.
I see in light and dark I the faces of people flickering in the
flames of the bonfire. I am a tree that burns with hard
pleasure. A single sweetness possesses me: complicity with the
world. I love my cross, which I painfully carry. It’s the least I
can make of my life: accept commiserably the sacrifice of the
night.
The strangeness takes me: so I open the black umbrella and
throw myself into a feast of dancing where stars sparkle. The
furious nerve inside me and that contorts. Until the early hours
come and find me bloodless. The early hours are great and
eat me. The gale calls me. I follow it and tear myself to pieces.
If I don’t enter the game that unfolds in life I shall lose my
own life in a suicide of my species. I protect with fire the
game of my life. When the existence of me and of the world
can no longer be borne by reason— then I loose myself and
follow a latent truth. Would I recognise the truth if it were
proven?
I am making myself. I make myself until I reach the pit.
About me in the world I want to tell you about the strength
that guides me and brings me the world itself, about the vital
sensuality of clear structures, and about the curves that are
organically connected to other curved shapes. My handwriting
and my circumvolutions are potent and the freedom that blows
in summer has fatality in itself. The eroticism that belongs to
whatever is living is scattered in the air, in the sea, in the
plants, in us, scattered in the vehemence of my voice, I write
you with my voice. And there is a vigor of the robust trunk,
of roots buried in the living earth that reacts giving great
sustenance. I breathe the energy by night. And all this in the
realm of the fantastic. Fantastic: the world for an instant is
exactly what my heart asks. I am about to die and construct
new compositions. I’m expressing myself very badly and the
right words escape me. My internal form has been carefully
purified and yet my bond with the world has the naked
crudity of free dreams and of great realities. I do not know
prohibition. And my own strength frees me, that full life that
overflows me. And I plan nothing in my intuitive work of
living: I work with the indirect, the informal and the
unforeseen.
Now in the early hours I am pale and gasping for breath and
have a dry mouth dry in the face of what I achieve. Nature in
choral canticle and I dying. What does nature sing? the last
word itself that is never again I. The centuries will fall upon
me. But for now a fierceness of body and soul that shows
itself in the rich scalding of heavy words that trample one
another—and something wild, primary and enervated rises from
my swamps, the accursed plant that is about to surrender to
God. The more accursed, the nearer toward the God. I
deepened myself in myself and found that I want bloody life,
and the occult meaning has an intensity that has light. It is the
secret light of a knowledge of fatality: the cornerstone of the
earth. It is more an omen of life than actual life. I exorcise it
excluding the profane. In my world little freedom of action is
granted me. I am free only to carry out the fatal gestures. My
anarchy obeys subterraneously a law in which I deal occultly
with astronomy, mathematics and mechanics. The liturgy of the
dissonant swarms of the insects that emerge from the foggy
and pestilential swamps. Insects, frogs, lice, flies, fleas and
bedbugs—all born of the corrupted diseased germination of
larvae. And my hunger is fed by these putrefying beings in
decomposition. My rite is a purifier of forces. But malignancy
exists in the jungle. I swallow a mouthful of blood that fills me
entirely. I hear cymbals and trumpets and tambourines that fill
the air with noise and uproar drowning out the silence of the
disc of the sun and its marvel. I want a cloak woven from
threads of solar gold. The sun is the magical tension of the
silence. On my journey to the mysteries I hear the carnivorous
plant that laments times immemorial: and I have obscene
nightmares beneath the sick winds. I am enchanted, seduced,
transfixed by furtive voices. The almost unintelligible cuneiform
inscriptions speak of how to conceive and give formulae about
how to feed from the force of darkness. They speak of naked
and crawling females. And the solar eclipse causes secret terror
that nonetheless announces a splendor of heart. I place upon
my hair the bronze diadem.
Beyond thought—even further beyond it—is the ceiling I looked
at when I was an infant. Suddenly I was crying. It was already
love. Or I wasn’t even crying. I was on the lookout.
Scrutinizing the ceiling. The instant is the vast egg of lukewarm
entrails.
Now it’s early morning again.
But at dawn I think that we are the contemporaries of the
following day. May the God help me: I am lost. I need you
terribly. We must be two. So that the wheat can grow tall. I
am so earnest that I’m going to stop.
I was born a few instants ago and I am dimmed.
The crystals clink and sparkle. The wheat is ripe: the bread is
shared out. But with sweetness? It’s important to know. I don’t
think just as the diamond doesn’t think. I shine wholly limpid. I
have neither hunger nor thirst: I am. I have two eyes that are
open. Toward the nothing. Toward the ceiling.
I’m going to make an adagio. Read slowly and with peace. It’s
a wide fresco.
Being born is like this:
The sunflowers slowly turn their corollas toward the sun. The
wheat is ripe. The bread is eaten with sweetness. My impulse
connects to that of the roots of the trees.
Birth: the poor have a prayer in Sanskrit. They ask for
nothing: they are poor in spirit. Birth: the Africans have black
and dark skin. Many are the sons of the Queen of Sheba and
King Solomon. The Africans to put me to sleep, I newly born,
intone a primary rigmarole where they sing monotonously that
the mother-in-law, as soon as they go out, comes and takes a
bunch of bananas.
There’s a love song of theirs that also says monotonously the
lament I make my own: why do I love you if you don’t return
my love? I send messengers in vain; when I greet you you
hide your face from me; why do I love you if you don’t even
notice me? There is also a lullaby for elephants who go bathe
in the river. I am African: a thread of a sad and wide and
sylvan lament runs through my voice that sings to you. The
whites whipped the blacks. But as the swan secretes an oil that
makes its skin impermeable—in that way the blacks’ pain
cannot enter and does not hurt. You can transform pain into
pleasure—a “click” is enough. Black swan?
But there are those who starve to death and all I can do is
be born. My rigmarole is: what can I do for them? My
answer is: paint a fresco in adagio. I could suffer the hunger
of others in silence but a contralto voice makes me sing—I sing
dull and black. It’s my message of a person alone. A person
eats another from hunger. But I fed myself with my own
placenta. And I’m not going to bite my nails because this is a
tranquil adagio.
I stopped to drink cool water: the glass at this instant-now is
of thick faceted crystal and with thousands of glints of instants.
Are objects halted time?
The moon is still full. Clocks stopped and the sound of a
hoarse carillon runs down the wall. I want to be buried with
the watch on my wrist so that in the earth something can
pulse time.
I am so broad. I am coherent—my canticle is profound. Slow.
But rising. Rising still. If it rises much more it will become full
moon and silence, and phantasmagoric lunar soil. On the
lookout for the time that stops. What I write you is serious. It
will become a hard imperishable object. What is coming is
unexpected. To be uselessly sincere I must say that now it is
six fifteen in the morning.
The risk—I’m daring to discover new lands. Where never
human steps trod. First I must pass through the perfumed
vegetable matter. I was given a night jessamine that is on my
terrace. I’m going to start making my own perfume: I buy the
right alcohol and the essence of whatever is already crushed
and especially the fixer which must be of purely animal origin.
Heavy musk. This is the final low chord of the adagio. My
number is 9. It’s 7. It’s 8. All beyond thought. If all this exists,
then I am. But why this unease? It’s because I’m not living in
the only way that exists for everyone to live and I don’t even
know which one it is. Uncomfortable. I don’t feel well. I don’t
know what it is. But something is wrong and making me
uneasy. Yet I am being frank and playing fair. I show my
cards. I just don’t tell the facts of my life: I’m secretive by
nature. So what’s wrong? I just know that I don’t want
cheating. I refuse. I deepened myself but I don’t believe in
myself because my thought is invented.
I can already prepare for the “he” or “she.” The adagio
reached its end. So I start. I don’t lie. My truth sparkles like a
pendant on a crystal chandelier.
But it is hidden. I can stand it because I’m strong: I ate my
own placenta.
Though everything is so fragile. I feel so lost. I live off a secret
that glows in luminous rays that would darken me if I didn’t
cover them with a heavy cloak of false certainties. May the
God help me: I am without a guide and it is dark once again.
Will I have to die again in order to be born once again? I
accept.
I’ll return to the unknown part of myself and when I am born
shall speak of “he” or “she.” For now, what sustains me is the
“that” that is an “it.” To create a being out of oneself is very
serious. I am creating myself. And walking in complete darkness
in search of ourselves is what we do. It hurts. But these are
the pains of childbirth: a thing is born that is. Is itself. It is
hard as a dry stone. But the core is soft and alive, perishable,
perilous it
. Life of elementary matter.
As the God has no name I shall give Him the name of
Simptar. It belongs to no language. I shall give myself the
name of Amptala. As far as I know no such name exists.
Perhaps in a language before Sanskrit, it language. I hear the
tick-tock of the clock: so I make haste. The tick-tock is it
.
I think I am not going to die in the next instant because the
doctor who examined me thoroughly said that I am in perfect
health. See? the instant passed and I didn’t die. I want to be
buried straight in the ground though inside a coffin. I don’t
want to be filed in a wall as in the São João Batista cemetery
where there’s no more room in the ground. So they invented
those diabolical walls where you are held as in a filing cabinet.
Now it is an instant. Do you feel it? I do.
The air is “
it” and has no perfume. I like that too. But I like
night jessamine, musky because its sweetness is a surrender to
the moon. I’ve eaten jelly made from small scarlet roses: its
taste blesses us even as it assaults. How to reproduce the taste
in words? The taste is one and the words are many. As for
music, where does it go? The only concrete thing in music is
the instrument. Far beyond thought I have a musical
background. But even farther beyond there is the beating heart.
Therefore the most profound thought is a beating heart.
I want to die with life. I swear that I shall only die profiting
from the last instant. There is a profound prayer within me
that will be born I don’t know when. I would so like to die of
health. Like someone exploding. Éclater is better: j’éclate. For
now there’s dialogue with you. Then it will be monologue. Then
the silence. I know that there will be an order.
Chaos readies itself again like musical instruments that are
tuned before the electronic music begins. I am improvising and
the beauty of what I improvise is a fugue. I feel throbbing
within me the prayer that has not yet come. I feel that I shall
ask for the facts just to run off me without getting me wet. I
am ready for the great silence of death. I will go to sleep.
I got up. The coup de grâce. Because I’m tired of defending
myself. I’m innocent. Even naive because I surrender without
any guarantees. I was born by Order. I’m entirely calm. I
breathe by Order. I have no lifestyle: I reached the impersonal,
which is so difficult. Soon the Order will command me to
surpass the maximum. Surpassing the maximum is living the
pure element. There are people who can’t stand it: they vomit.
But I am used to blood.
What beautiful music I can hear in the depths of me. It is
made of geometric lines crisscrossing in the air. It is chamber
music. Chamber music has no melody. It is a way of
expressing the silence. I’m sending you chamber writing.
And this writing I’m attempting is a way of thrashing myself
free. I’m terrified. Why were there dinosaurs on this Earth?
how does a race die out?
I notice that I’m writing as if I were between sleep and
wakefulness.
It’s because I suddenly see that I haven’t been understanding
for a long time. Is the edge of my knife growing blunt? It
seems more probable to me that I don’t understand why what
I am seeing now is difficult: I’m slyly coming into contact with
a reality new to me that still has no corresponding thoughts
and not even a word that signifies it—it is a sensation beyond
thought.
And here’s where my evil rules me. I am still the cruel queen
of the Medes and the Persians and am also a slow evolution
that throws itself like a drawbridge to a future whose milky
clouds I’m already breathing. My aura is of the mystery of life.
I surpass myself abdicating from my name, and then I am the
world. I follow the voice of the world with a single voice.
What I write to you has no beginning: it’s a continuation.
From the words of this chant, chant which is mine and yours,
a halo arises that transcends the phrases, do you feel it? My
experience comes from having already managed to paint the
halo of things. The halo is more important than the things and
the words. The halo is dizzying. I plunge the word into the
deserted emptiness: it’s a word like a slim monolithic block that
gives off shadow. And it’s a heralding trumpet. The halo is the
it
.
I need to feel again the it of animals. For a long time I
haven’t been in contact with primitive animal life. I need to
study animals. I want to capture the it in order not to paint
an eagle and a horse, but a horse with the open wings of a
great eagle.
I shiver all over when I come into physical contact with
animals or simply see them. Animals fantasticate me. They are
time that does not measure itself. I seem to have a certain
horror for the living creature that is not human and that has
my own instincts though free and indomitable. The animal
never substitutes one thing for another.
Animals don’t laugh. Though sometimes dogs laugh. Besides
their panting mouths their smile is transmitted by eyes that
start to shine and become more sensual, while their tails wag
in joyous expectation. But cats never laugh. A “he” I know
wants nothing more to do with cats. He’s through with them
forever because he had a certain female cat who periodically
got frenzied. When she was in heat her instincts were so
imperative that, after long and plangent meows, she would
throw herself from the roof and injure herself on the ground.
Sometimes I get electrified when I see animals. I’m now
hearing the ancestral cry within me: I no longer seem to know
who is the creature, the animal or me. And I get all confused.
It seems I get scared of facing up to stifled instincts that I’m
forced to acknowledge in the presence of the animal.
I knew a “she” who humanized animals talking to them and
giving them her own characteristics. I don’t humanize animals
because it’s an offense—you must respect their nature—I am
the one who animalizes myself. It’s not hard and comes simply.
It’s just a matter of not fighting it and it’s just surrendering.
Nothing is more difficult than surrendering to the instant. That
difficulty is human pain. It is ours. I surrender in words and
surrender when I paint.
Holding a little bird in the half-closed cup of your hand is
terrible, like having the trembling instants inside your hand. The
frightened little bird chaotically beats thousands of wings and
suddenly you have in your half-closed hand the thin wings
struggling and suddenly you can’t bear it and quickly open
your hand to free the light prisoner. Or you hand it quickly
back to its owner so that he can give it the relatively greater
freedom of the cage. Birds—I want them in the trees or flying
far from my hands. I may one day grow intimate with them
and take pleasure in their lightweight presence of an instant.
“Take pleasure in their lightweight presence” gives me the
feeling of having written a complete sentence because it says
exactly what it is: the levitation of the birds.
It would never occur to me to have an owl, though I have
painted them in caves. But a “she” found a fledgling on the
forest floor in Santa Teresa all alone and bereft of a mother.
She took it home. She cuddled it. She fed it and cooed to it
and eventually found out that it liked raw meat. When it grew
up you might expect it to flee immediately but it was in no
hurry to go off in search of its destiny that would be to join
others of its mad race: it had grown fond, that diabolical bird,
of the girl. Until in a leap—as if struggling with itself—it freed
itself with a flight into the depth of the world.
I have seen wild horses in the meadows where at night the
white horse—king of nature—cast into the high air its long
neigh of glory. I have had perfect relations with them. I
remember standing with the same haughtiness as the horse
and running my hand through its naked fur. Through its wild
mane. I felt like this: the woman and the horse.
I know old stories but that renews themselves now. The he
told me that for some time he lived with part of his family in
a little village in a valley in the high snowy Pyrenees. In the
winter the starving wolves came down from the mountains to
the village on the track of prey. All the inhabitants bolted
themselves attentive in their houses sheltering in the main room
sheep and horses and dogs and goats, human warmth and
animal warmth—all alertly hearing the scraping of the claws of
the wolves upon the closed doors. Listening. Listening.
I am melancholy. It is morning. But I know the secret of pure
mornings. And I relax in the melancholy.
I know the story of a rose. Does it seem strange to you to
speak of a rose when I am talking about animals? But it acted
in a way that recalls the animal mysteries. Every two days I
would buy a rose and place it in water in a vase made
specially narrow to hold the long stem of a single flower. Every
two days the rose would wilt and I would exchange it for
another. Until one certain rose. It was rose-colored without
coloring or grafting just naturally of the most vivid rose color.
Its beauty expanded the heart by great breadths. It seemed so
proud of the turgescence of its wide open corolla and of its
own petals that its haughtiness held it almost erect. Because it
was not completely erect: with graciousness it bent over its
stem which was fine and fragile. An intimate relationship
intensely developed between me and the flower: I admired her
and she seemed to feel admired. And she became so glorious
in her apparition and was observed with such love that days
went by and she did not wilt: her corolla remained wide open
and swollen, fresh as a newborn flower. She lasted in beauty
and life an entire week. Only then did she start to show signs
of some fatigue. Then she died. It was with reluctance that I
replaced her. And I never forgot her. The strange thing is that
my maid asked me once out of the blue: “and that rose?” I
didn’t ask which one. I knew. That rose that lived from love
given at length was remembered because the woman had seen
how I looked at the flower and transmitted to her the waves
of my energy. She had blindly intuited that something had
gone on between me and the rose. That rose—made me want
to call it “jewel of my life,” because I often give things
names—had so much instinct by nature that I and she had
been able to live each other profoundly, as only can happen
between beast and man.
Not having been born an animal is a secret nostalgia of mine.
They sometimes clamor for many generations from afar and I
can’t respond except by growing restless. It’s the call.
This free air, this wind that strikes me in the soul of the face
leaving it troubled in an imitation of an anguished ever-new
ecstasy, anew and always, every time the plunge into a
bottomless thing into which I fall always ceaselessly falling until I
die and achieve at last silence. Oh sirocco wind, I do not
forgive thee for death, thou who bringest me a damaged
memory of things lived that, alas for me, always repeat
themselves, even in other and different forms. The lived thing
scares me as the future scares me. That, like things that have
passed, is intangible, mere supposition.
I am at this instant in a white void awaiting the next instant.
Measuring time is just a working hypothesis. But whatever
exists is perishable and this forces us to measure immutable
and permanent time. It never began and never will end. Never.
I heard about a she who died in bed but screaming: my
light’s going out! Until there was the favor of the coma inside
which she freed herself from her body and had no fear of
death.
Before writing to you I perfume myself all over.
I know you all over because I have lived you all over. In me
life is profound. The early hours find me pale from having
lived the night of deep dreams. Though sometimes I float on a
visible shoal that has beneath it dark blue almost black depths.
That is why I write to you. On a waft of thick seaweed and in
the tender wellspring of love.
I’m going to die: there’s that tension like that of a bow about
to loose an arrow. I remember the sign of Sagittarius: half
man and half animal. The human part in classical rigidity holds
the bow and arrow. The bow could shoot at any instant and
hit the target. I know that I shall hit the target.
Now I’m going to write wherever my hand leads: I won’t fiddle
with whatever it writes. This is a way to have no lag between
the instant and I: I act in the core of the instant. But there’s
still some lag. It starts like this: as love impedes death, and I
don’t know what I mean by that. I trust in my own
incomprehension that gives me life free of understanding, I lost
friends, I don’t understand death. The horrible duty is to go to
the end. And counting on no one. To live your life yourself.
And to suffer as much to dull myself a bit. Because I can no
longer carry the sorrows of the world. What can I do when I
feel totally what other people are and feel? I live them but no
longer have the strength. I don’t want to tell even myself
certain things. It would be to betray the is-itself. I feel that I
know some truths. Which I already foresee. But truths have no
words. Truths or truth? I’m not going to speak of the God,
He is my secret. The sun is shining today. The beach was full
of a nice wind and a freedom. And I was on my own.
Without needing anybody. It’s hard because I need to share
what I feel with you. The calm sea. But on the lookout and
suspicious. As if a calm like that couldn’t last. Something’s
always about to happen. The unforeseen, improvised and fatal,
fascinates me. I have started to communicate so strongly with
you that I stopped being while still existing. You became an I.
It’s so hard to speak and say things that can’t be said. It’s so
silent. How to translate the silence of the real encounter
between the two of us? So hard to explain: I looked straight at
you for a few instants. Such moments are my secret. There
was what’s called perfect communion. I call it an acute state of
happiness. I’m terribly lucid and it seems I’m reaching a higher
plane of humanity. Or of unhumanity—the it.
What I do by involuntary instinct cannot be described.
What am I doing in writing to you? trying to photograph
perfume.
I’m writing to you seated beside an open window up in my
studio.
I’m writing you this facsimile of a book, the book of someone
who doesn’t know how to write; but that’s because in the
lightest realm of speaking I almost don’t know how to speak.
Particularly speaking to you in writing, I who got used to your
being the audience, however distracted, of my voice. When I
paint I respect the material I use, I respect its primordial fate.
So when I write you I respect the syllables.
New instant in which I see what is coming. Though to speak
of the instant of vision I must be more discursive than the
instant: many instants will pass before I unfold and exhaust the
single and quick complexity of a glance.
I’m writing to you in time with my breath. Shall I always be
hermetic as in my painting? Because it seems you have to be
terribly explicit. Am I explicit? I don’t really care. Now I’m
going to light a cigarette. Perhaps I’ll go back to the typewriter
or perhaps I’ll stop right here forever. I, who am never good
enough.
I came back. I’m thinking about turtles. Once I said by pure
intuition that the turtle was a dinosauric animal. Later I read
that it really is. I have the strangest thoughts. One day I’ll
paint turtles. They interest me a lot. All living beings, except
man, are a scandal of astonishment: we were modelled and a
lot of raw material was left over—it
—and so the beasts were
formed. Why a turtle? Maybe the title of what I’m writing you
should be a little like that and in the form of a question:
“What about turtles?” You who are reading me would say: it’s
true that it’s been a long time since I thought about turtles.
I suddenly got so distressed that I might just say enough
already and finish what I’m writing to you, it’s more based on
blind words. Even for unbelievers there’s the instant of despair
that is divine: the absence of the God is an act of religion. At
this very instant I’m asking the God to help me. I’m needing.
Needing more than human strength. I am strong but also
destructive. The God must come to me since I haven’t gone to
Him. Let the God come: please. Though I don’t deserve it.
Come. Or perhaps those who least deserve Him need Him
most. I’m restless and harsh and hopeless. Though I have love
inside myself. It’s just that I don’t know how to use love.
Sometimes it scratches like barbs. If I received so much love
inside me and nonetheless am restless it’s because I need the
God to come. Come before it’s too late. I’m in danger like
every person who lives. And the only thing I can expect is
precisely the unexpected. But I know that I shall have peace
before death and that one day I shall taste the delicateness of
life. I shall notice—as we eat and live the taste of food. My
voice falls into the abyss of your silence. You read me in
silence. But in this unlimited silent field I unfurl my wings, free
to live. So I accept the worst and enter the core of death and
that is why I’m alive. The feeling core. And that it makes me
quiver.
Now I shall speak of the sadness of flowers so as to feel more
of the order of whatever exists. Before I do, I’ll give you the
nectar with pleasure, sweet juice that many flowers contain and
that insects seek with greed. The pistil is the flower’s female
organ that generally occupies the centre and contains the
beginnings of the seed. Pollen is fertilizing powder produced in
the stamens and contained in the anthers. The stamen is the
flower’s masculine organ. It’s composed of the filament and the
anther in the lower section surrounding the pistil. Fertilization is
the union of the two elements of reproduction—masculine and
feminine—from which comes the fertilized fruit. “And Yahweh
God planted a garden in Eden which is in the East, and there
he put the man whom He had formed” (Gen. II-8).
I want to paint a rose.
Rose is the feminine flower that gives herself wholly and such
that the only thing left to her is the joy of having given
herself. Her perfume is a crazy mystery. When inhaled deeply
it touches the intimate depth of the heart and leaves the inside
of the entire body perfumed. The way she opens herself into a
woman is so beautiful. The petals have a good taste in the
mouth —all you have to do is try. Yet rose is not it but she.
The scarlet ones are of great sensuality. The white ones are
the peace of the God. It’s very rare to find white ones at the
florists’. The yellow ones are of a happy alarm. The pink ones
are in general fleshier and have the perfect color. The orange
ones are produced by grafting and are sexually attractive.
Pay attention and as a favour: I’m inviting you to move to a
new kingdom.
Now the carnation has an aggressiveness that comes from a
certain irritation. The ends of its petals are rough and
impudent. The carnation’s perfume is somehow mortal. Red
carnations bellow in violent beauty. The white ones recall the
little coffin of a dead child—that’s when the scent becomes
pungent and we turn our heads away in horror. How to
transplant the carnation onto canvas?
The sunflower is the great child of the sun. So much so that it
knows how to turn its enormous corolla toward the one who
made it. It doesn’t matter if it’s father or mother. I don’t
know. I wonder if the sunflower is a feminine or masculine
flower? I think masculine.
The violet is introverted and its introspection is profound. They
say it hides away out of modesty. Not true. It hides away in
order to capture its own secret. Its almost-not-perfume is a
smothered glory but demands that people seek it. It never
shouts its perfume. Violet says frivolous things that cannot be
said.
The golden everlasting is always dead. Its dryness aspires to
eternity. Its name in Greek means: sun of gold. The daisy is a
happy little flower. It is simple and on the surface of the skin.
It has but a single layer of petals. Its centre is a child’s game.
The beautiful orchid is exquise and unpleasant. It isn’t
spontaneous. It needs a glass dome. But it is a magnificent
woman and that cannot be denied. Nor can it be denied that
it is noble because it is epiphytic. Epiphytes are born on other
plants without however taking nutrition from them. I was lying
when I said it was unpleasant. I adore orchids. They’re born
artificial, they’re born art.
The tulip is only a tulip in Holland. A single tulip simply is not.
They need an open field in order to be.
Cornflowers only grow amidst the wheat. In their humility they
have the audacity to appear in various shapes and colors. The
cornflower is biblical. In the nativity scenes of Spain it isn’t
separated from the stalks of wheat. It is a little beating heart.
But angelica is dangerous. It has the perfume of the chapel. It
brings ecstasy. It recalls the Host. Many wish to eat it and fill
their mouths with the intense sacred scent.
Jasmine is for lovers. It makes you want to put an ellipsis
now. They walk holding hands, swinging their arms and giving
each other gentle kisses to the fragrant almost-sound of
jasmine.
Bird-of-paradise is pure masculinity. It has an aggressiveness of
love and of healthy pride. It seems to have a cock’s comb and
his crow. It just doesn’t wait for dawn. The violence of your
beauty.
Night jessamine has a perfume of the full moon. It’s
phantasmagoric and a bit frightening and is for people who like
danger. It only emerges at night with its dizzying scent. Night
jessamine is silent. And also belongs to the deserted street
corner and in the dark and the gardens of houses whose
lights are off and windows are shut. It’s highly dangerous: it’s
a whistle in the dark, which no one can bear. But I can bear
it because I love danger. As for the succulent flower of the
cactus, it is large and scented and of a vivid color. It’s the
succulent revenge that the desert plant makes. It is splendor
being born of the despotic sterility.
I can’t be bothered to speak of edelweiss. Because it’s found at
an altitude of three thousand four hundred metres. It’s white
and woolly. Rarely reachable: it’s aspiration.
Geranium is the flower of window boxes. You find it in São
Paulo, in the neighborhood of Grajaú and in Switzerland.
Giant water lilies are in the Botanical Gardens in Rio de
Janeiro. Enormous and up to two metres in diameter. Aquatic,
they’re to die for. They are the Amazonian: the dinosaur of
flowers. They give off great calm. Both majestic and simple.
And despite living on the water’s surface they cast shade. What
I’m writing you is in Latin: de natura florum. Later I’ll show
you my study already transformed into a linear design.
The chrysanthemum is of a deep happiness. It speaks through
its color and its unruly shock of hair. It’s a flower that untidily
controls its own wildness.
I think I’m going to have to ask permission to die. But I can’t,
it’s too late. I heard “The Firebird”—and drowned entirely.
I must interrupt because—didn’t I say? didn’t I say that one
day a thing would happen to me? Well it just happened. A
man called João spoke to me on the phone. He grew up in
the depths of the Amazon. And he says that there’s a legend
there about a talking plant. It’s called the tajá. And they say
that once indigenous people have charmed it in a ritual way, it
may even say a word. João told me something that has no
explanation: once he came home late and when he was
walking down the hall where the plant was he heard the word
“João.” So he thought it was his mother calling him and
replied: I’m coming. He went upstairs but found his mother
and father snoring and sound asleep.
I’m tired. My tiredness comes often because I’m an extremely
busy person: I look after the world. Every day I look from my
terrace at a section of beach and sea and see the thick foam
is whiter and that during the night the waters crept forward
uneasy. I see this by the mark which the waves leave upon
the sand. I look at the almond trees on the street where I live.
Before going to sleep I look after the world and see if the
night sky is starry and navy blue because on certain nights
instead of being black the sky seems to be an intense navy
blue, a color I’ve painted in stained glass. I like intensities. I
look after the boy who is nine years old and dressed in rags
and all skin and bones. He will get tuberculosis, if he doesn’t
already have it. In the Botanical Gardens, then, I get worn out.
With my glance I must look after thousands of plants and
trees and especially the giant water lily. It’s there. And I look
at her.
Note that I don’t mention my emotional impressions: I lucidly
speak about some of the thousands of things and people I
look after. Nor is it a job because I don’t earn any money
from it. I just get to know what the world is like.
Is it a lot of work to look after the world? Yes. For example:
it forces me to remember the inexpressive and therefore
frightening face of the woman I saw on the street. With my
eyes I look after the misery of the people who live on the
hillsides.
You will no doubt ask me why I look after the world. It’s
because I was born charged with the task.
As a child I looked after a line of ants: they walk single file
carrying a tiny piece of leaf. That doesn’t keep each one from
communicating something to the ones coming the other way.
Ant and bee are not it
. They are they
.
I read the book about the bees and ever since have looked
after the queen bee most of all. Bees fly and deal with flowers.
Is that banal? I saw it myself. Noting the obvious is part of the
job. Inside each little ant fits a whole world that will escape me
if I’m not careful. For example: an instinctive sense of
organization, language beyond the supersonic, and feelings of
sex fit in the ant. Now I can’t find a single ant to look at. I
know there wasn’t a massacre because otherwise I’d have
already heard.
Looking after the world also demands a lot of patience: I have
to wait for the day when an ant turns up.
I just haven’t found anyone to report back to. Or have I?
Since I’m reporting back to you right here. I’m going to report
back to you right now on that spring that was so dry. The
radio crackled as it picked up your static. Clothing bristled as it
let go of the electricity of the body and the comb raised
magnetized hair—that was a hard spring. It was exhausted by
the winter and budded all electric. Wherever it was it headed
afar. There had never been so many paths. We spoke little,
you and I. I don’t know why the whole world was so annoyed
and electronically able. But able to what? The body heavy with
sleep. And our big eyes inexpressive as the wide-open eyes of
a blind man. On the terrace the fish was in an aquarium and
we drank juice in that hotel bar overlooking the landscape.
With the wind came the dream of goats: at the next table a
solitary faun. We looked at our glasses of ice-cold juice and
dreamed statically inside the transparent glass. “What did you
say?” you were asking. “I didn’t say anything.” Days and more
days passed and everything in that danger and the geraniums
so scarlet. An instant of tuning-in was all it took and once
again we picked up the ragged static of spring in the wind: the
goats’ impudent dream and the fish all empty and our sudden
inclination to steal fruit. The faun now crowned in solitary
leaps. “What?” “I didn’t say anything.” But I noticed a first
rumble like that of a heart beating beneath the earth. I quietly
put my ear to the ground and heard summer forcing its way
in and my heart beneath the earth—“nothing! I said
nothing!”—and I felt the patient brutality with which the closed
earth was opening inside in birth, and I knew with what weight
of sweetness the summer was ripening a hundred thousand
oranges and I knew that the oranges were mine. Because that
is what I wanted.
I’m proud that I can always feel a change in the weather
coming. There’s a thing in the air—the body alerts me that
something new is coming and I bristle all over. I don’t know
why. That very spring I was given the plant called primula. It’s
so mysterious that in its mystery is contained the inexplicable
part of nature. It doesn’t look at all unique. But on the precise
day when spring starts its leaves die and in their place are
born closed flowers that have an extremely dumbfounding
feminine and masculine perfume.
We’re sitting nearby and vaguely watching. And suddenly they
start leisurely opening and surrendering to the new season in
front of our aghast eyes: it’s spring that is moving in.
But when winter comes I give and give and give. I bundle up
quite a lot. I hug nests of people to my warm breast. And you
hear the noise of someone having hot soup. I am now living
rainy days: the time nears for me to give.
Can’t you see that this is like a child being born? It hurts.
Pain is exacerbated life. The process hurts. Coming-to-be is a
slow and slow good pain. It’s the wide stretching as far one
can go. And your blood thanks you. I breathe, I breathe. The
air is it. Air with wind is already a he or she. If I had to
force myself to write you I would be so sad. Sometimes I can’t
stand the strength of inspiration. Then I paint with a heavy
heart. It’s so good that things don’t depend on me.
I’ve spoken a lot about death. But I’m going to speak to you
about the breath of life. When a person is already no longer
breathing you give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation: you place
your mouth upon the other person’s and breathe. And the
other starts to breathe again. This exchange of breaths is one
of the most beautiful things that I’ve ever heard about life. In
fact the beauty of this mouth-to-mouth is dazzling me.
Oh, how uncertain everything is. And yet part of the Order. I
don’t even know what I’ll write to you in the next sentence.
We never say the final truth. May whoever knows the truth
come forward. And speak. We shall listen contritely.
. . . suddenly I saw him and he was such an extraordinarily
handsome and virile man that I felt a joy of creation. Not that
I wanted him for myself just as I don’t want for myself the
boy I saw with the hair of an archangel running after a ball. I
just wanted to look. The man looked at me for an instant and
smiled calmly: he knew how beautiful he was and I know that
he knew that I didn’t want him for myself. He smiled because
he felt no threat at all. Because beings exceptional in any way
are subject to more dangers than your average person. I
crossed the street and took a taxi. The breeze made the hairs
on my neck stand up. And I was so happy that I huddled in
the corner of the taxi out of fear because happiness hurts.
And all that caused by having seen the handsome man. I still
didn’t want him for myself—what I like are people who are a
little ugly and at the same time harmonious, but he somehow
had given me a lot with his smile of camaraderie among
people who understand each other. I didn’t understand any of
this.
The courage to live: I keep hidden what needs to be hidden
and needs to irradiate in secret.
I hush.
Because I don’t know what my secret is. Tell me yours, teach
me about the secret of each one of us. Not a slanderous
secret. It’s just this: secret.
And it has no formulas.
I think I’ll now have to beg your pardon to die a little.
Please—may I? I won’t be long. Thank you.
. . . No. I didn’t manage to die. Am I ending this “word-thing”
here by a voluntary act? Not yet.
I am transfiguring reality—what is it that’s escaping me? why
don’t I reach out my hand and take it? It’s because I only
dreamed of the world but never saw it.
What I’m writing to you is contralto. It’s negro-spiritual. It has
a choir and lit candles. I’m now having a dizzy spell. I’m a bit
afraid. Where will my freedom lead me? What is this that I’m
writing to you? That leaves me all alone. But I go and pray
and my freedom is ruled by the Order—I’m already without
fear. All that’s guiding me is a sense of discovery. Beyond
what’s beyond thought.
Following myself along is really what I’m doing when writing to
you and now: following myself without knowing where it will
lead me. Sometimes it’s so hard to follow myself along. Because
I’m following something that’s still nothing more than a nebula.
Sometimes I end up giving up.
Now I’m afraid. Because I’m going to tell you something. Wait
until the fear passes.
It passed. It’s this: dissonance is harmonious to me. Melody
sometimes wears me out. And also the so-called “leitmotif.” I
want in music and in what I write to you and in what I paint,
I want geometric streaks that cross in the air and form a
disharmony that I understand. Pure it. My being is completely
absorbed and grows slightly intoxicated. What I’m telling you is
very important. And I work while I sleep: because that is when
I move inside the mystery.
Today is Sunday morning. On this Sunday of sun and Jupiter
I am alone in the house. I suddenly doubled over as if in the
deep pain of childbirth—and saw that the girl in me was dying.
I shall never forget that bloody Sunday. It will take time for
the wound to heal. And here I am tough and silent and
heroic. Without a girl inside me. All lives are heroic lives.
Creation escapes me. And I don’t even want to know so
much. That my heart beats in my breast is enough. The
impossible living of the it is enough.
Right this minute I feel my heart beating out of control inside
my breast. It’s reasserting itself because in the past few
sentences I was just thinking on my surface. So the basis of
existence turns up to wash over and erase the traces of the
thought. The sea erases the traces of the waves on the sand.
Oh God, how happy I’m feeling. What ruins happiness is fear.
I get scared. But my heart’s beating. The inexplicable love
makes the heart beat faster. The sole guarantee is that I was
born. You are a form of being I, and I a form of being you:
those are the limits of my possibility.
I’m in a pleasure to die for. Sweet prostration as I speak to
you. But there’s the waiting. Waiting is feeling voracious about
the future. One day you said you loved me. I pretend to
believe it and live, from day to day, in joyful love. But
remembering with longing is like saying farewell once again.
A fantastical world surrounds me and is me. I hear the mad
song of a little bird and crush butterflies between my fingers.
I’m a fruit eaten away by a worm. And I await the orgasmic
apocalypse. A dissonant throng of insects surrounds me, light of
an oil lamp that I am. I then go too far in order to be. I’m in
a trance. I penetrate the surrounding air. What a fever: I can’t
stop living. In this dense jungle of words that thickly wrap
around whatever I feel and think and live and transform
everything I am into something of mine that nonetheless
remains entirely outside me. I’m watching myself think. What I
wonder is: who is it in me who is even outside of thinking?
I’m writing you all this because it’s a challenge which I have to
accept with humility. I’m haunted by my ghosts, by whatever is
mythic and fantastical—life is supernatural. And I walk on a
tightrope up to the edge of my dream. Guts tortured by
voluptuousness guide me, fury of impulses. Before I organise
myself, I must disorganize myself internally. To experience that
first and fleeting primary state of freedom. Of the freedom to
err, fall and get up again.
But if I hope to understand in order to accept things— the act
of surrender will never happen. I must take the plunge all at
once, a plunge that includes comprehension and especially
incomprehension. And who am I to dare to think? What I
have to do is surrender. How is it done? I know however that
only by walking do you know how to walk and—miracle—find
yourself walking.
I, who manufacture the future like a diligent spider. And the
best of me is when I know nothing and manufacture whatever.
Because I suddenly see that I know nothing. Is the blade of
my knife getting blunt? I think it’s more likely that I don’t
understand because what I’m seeing now is difficult: I’m
stealthily entering into contact with a reality that is new to me
and still doesn’t have corresponding thoughts, and much less
any word that signifies it. It’s more of a feeling beyond
thought.
How can I explain it to you? I’ll try. It’s that I’m perceiving a
crooked reality. Seen through an oblique cut. Only now have I
sensed the oblique of life. I used to only see through straight
and parallel cuts. I didn’t notice the sly crooked line. Now I
sense that life is other. That living is not only unwinding rough
feelings—it’s something more bewitching and gracile, without
losing its fine animal vigor for that. Upon this unusually
crooked life I have placed my heavy paw, causing existence to
wither in its most oblique and fortuitous and yet at the same
time subtly fatal aspects. I understood the inevitability of
happenstance and that is no contradiction.
The oblique life is very intimate. I shall say no more about this
intimacy so as not to harm thinking-feeling with dry words. To
leave the obliqueness in its own uninhibited independence.
And I also know a way of life that is gentle pride, grace in
movements, slight and continuous frustration, with a skill in
avoidance that comes from a long and ancient history. As a
sign of revolt only a weightless and eccentric irony. There’s a
side to life that is like drinking coffee on a terrace in the
coldness of winter and wrapped in wool.
I also know a way of life that is slight shadow unfurled in the
wind and swaying slightly over the ground: life that is floating
shadow, levitation and dreams in the open day: I live the
richness of the earth.
Yes. Life is very oriental. Only a few people chosen by the
inevitability of chance have tasted the aloof and delicate
freedom of life. It’s like knowing how to arrange flowers in a
vase: almost useless knowledge. That fleeting freedom of life
must never be forgotten: it should be present like a fragrance.
To live this life is more an indirect remembering than a direct
living.
It resembles a gentle convalescence from something that
nonetheless could have been absolutely terrible. Convalescence
from a frigid pleasure. Only for the initiates life then becomes
fragilely truthful. And is in the instant-now: you eat the fruit
during its ripeness. Could I no longer know what I’m talking
about and is everything escaping me without my noticing? I do
know—but cautiously because I’m a hair’s breadth from not
knowing. I feed myself delicately with trivial daily life and drink
coffee on the terrace on the threshold of this dusk that looks
sickly only because it’s sweet and sensitive.
Oblique life? I am well aware that there is a slight detachment
between things, they almost collide, there is a detachment
among the beings that lose one other amongst words that
almost don’t say anything more. But we almost understand one
other in this light discord, in this almost that is the only way
to stand full life, since a sudden face-to-face encounter with it
would frighten us, scare off its delicate spider’s web threads.
We are askance in order not to jeopardise what we foresee is
infinitely other in this life of which I speak to you.
And I live to the side—a place where the central light doesn’t
burn me. And I speak quietly so that ears have to pay
attention and hear me.
But I also know of yet another life. I know and want it and
devour it ferociously. It’s a life of magical violence. It’s
mysterious and bewitching. In it snakes entwine while the stars
tremble. Drops of water drip in the phosphorescent darkness of
the cave. In that dark the flowers intertwine in a humid fairy
garden. And I am the sorceress of that silent bacchanal. I feel
defeated by my own corruptibility. And I see that I am
intrinsically bad. It’s only out of pure kindness that I am good.
Defeated by myself. Who lead me along the paths of the
salamander, the spirit who rules the fire and lives within it.
And I give myself as an offering to the dead. I weave spells
on the solstice, spectre of an exorcised dragon.
But I don’t know how to capture what’s happening now except
by living everything that happens to me here and now and
whatever it may be. I let the free horse run fiery in its pure
noble joy. I, who run nervously and only reality delimits me.
And when the day reaches its end I hear the crickets and
become entirely full and unintelligible. Then come the early
hours bulging full of thousands of blaring little birds. And each
thing that happens to me I live it here by noting it down.
Because I want to feel in my probing hands the living and
quivering nerve of the today.
Beyond thought I reach a state. I refuse to divide it up into
words—and what I cannot and do not want to express ends
up being the most secret of my secrets. I know that I’m
scared of the moments in which I don’t use thought and that’s
a momentary state that is difficult to reach, and which, entirely
secret, no longer uses the words with which thoughts are
produced. Is not using words to lose your identity? is it getting
lost in the harmful essential shadows?
I lose the identity of the world inside myself and exist without
guarantees. I achieve whatever is achievable but I live the
unachievable and the meaning of me and the world and you
isn’t obvious. It’s fantastic, and I handle myself in these
moments with immense delicacy. Is God a form of being? the
abstraction that materializes in the nature of all that exists? My
roots are in the divine shadows. Drowsy roots. Wavering in the
dark shadows.
And suddenly I feel that we shall soon part. My frightened
truth is that I was always yours alone and didn’t know it. Now
I know: I’m alone. I and my freedom that I don’t know how
to use. Great responsibility of solitude. Whoever isn’t lost
doesn’t know freedom and love it. As for me, I own up to my
solitude that sometimes falls into ecstasy as before fireworks. I
am alone and must live a certain intimate glory that in solitude
can become pain. And the pain, silence. I keep its name secret.
I need secrets in order to live.
For each one of us and at some lost moment of life—is a
mission announced that we must accomplish? I however refuse
any mission. I won’t accomplish anything: I just live.
It’s so odd and hard to substitute the paintbrush now for that
strangely familiar but always remote thing, the word. The
extreme and intimate beauty is within it. Yet it’s
unreachable—and when it’s within reach that’s when it becomes
illusory because once again it remains unreachable. From my
painting and these jostling words of mine a silence rises that is
also like the substratum of the eyes. There is a thing that
escapes me the whole time. When it doesn’t escape, I gain a
certitude: life is something else. It has an underlying style.
Could it be that in the instant of death I shall force life trying
to live more than I can? But I am today.
I write to you in disorder, I well know. But that is how I live.
I only work with the lost and found.
But writing for me is frustrating: when writing I’m dealing with
the impossible. With the enigma of nature. And of the God.
Whoever doesn’t know what God is, will never be able to
know. In the past is when the God was learned of. It’s
something already known.
Do I not have a plot to my life? for I am unexpectedly
fragmentary. I am piecemeal. My story is living. And I have no
fear of failure. Let failure annihilate me, I want the glory of
falling. My crippled angel who contorts all elusive, my angel
who fell from the heavens to the hell where he lives savoring
evil.
This is not a story because I don’t know any stories like this
but all I know how to do is go along saying and doing: it is
the story of instants that flee like fugitive tracks seen from the
window of a train.
We will meet this afternoon. And I won’t even talk to you
about this that I’m writing and which contains what I am and
which I give to you as a present though you won’t read it.
You will never read what I’m writing. And when I’ve noted
down my secret of being—I shall throw it away as if into the
sea. I’m writing you because you can’t accept what I am.
When I destroy my notes on the instants, will I return to my
nothing from which I extracted an everything? I must pay the
price. The price of someone who has a past that is only
renewed with passion in the strange present. When I think of
what I already lived through it seems to me I was shedding
my bodies along the paths.
It’s almost five in the morning. And the light of the fainting
dawn, cold blue steel and with the tang and tart sharp taste of
the day being born from the dark. And that emerges upon on
the surface of time, I livid too, I being born from the shadows,
impersonal, I who am it
.
I’ll tell you something: I don’t know how to paint either better
or worse than I do. I paint a “this.” And I write with
“this”—that is all I can do. Restless. The liters of blood that
circulate in the veins. The muscles contracting and relaxing. The
full-moon aura of the body. Parambolic— whatever that word
means. Parambolic as I am. I can’t sum myself up because
you can’t add a chair and two apples. I am a chair and two
apples. And I cannot be added up.
Once again I’m full of joyful happy love. Whatever you are I
quickly breathe in lapping up your halo of wonder before it
vanishes in the evaporation of the air. Is my fresh desire to
live me and to live you the very tessitura of life? The nature
of beings and of things—is God? So maybe if I demand a lot
of nature, I would stop dying? Can I violate death and clear
within it an opening for life?
I cut the pain of which I write to you and give you my
restless joy.
And in this instant-now I see white statues scattered in the
perspective of faraway distances far off—farther and farther in
the desert where I get lost with empty gaze, I myself a statue
to be seen from afar, I who am always getting lost. I am
savoring whatever exists. Hushed, aerial, inside my great dream.
Since I understand nothing—I therefore adhere to the faltering
mobile reality. I reach the real through the dream. I invent
you, reality. And hear you like remote bells deafly drowned in
the water pealing palpitating. Am I in the core of death? And
is that why I am alive? The feeling core. And this it exhilarates
me. I am alive. Like a wound, flower in the flesh, the path of
sorrowful blood is opened within me. With the direct and for
that very reason innocent eroticism of the Indians of the Holy
Pool. I, exposed to the storms, I, open inscription on the back
of a stone, within the large chronological spaces handed down
by the man of prehistory. The hot wind of great millenary
expanses blows and singes my surface.
Today I used red ochre, yellow ochre, black, and a little white.
I sense that I am near springs, pools and waterfalls, all with
abundant and fresh waters for my thirst. And I, a savage at
last and at last free of the dry days of today: I trot forward
and backward without frontiers. I carry out sun rituals on the
slopes of high mountains. But I am also taboo for myself,
untouchable because forbidden. Am I the hero that carries with
him the burning torch forever in a race?
Ah Force of whatever Exists, help me, Thou whom they call
the God. Why does the horrible-terrible call me? that I in my
horror want? because my demon is murderous and fears no
punishment: but the crime is more important than the
punishment. I enliven all of me in my happy instinct for
destruction.
Try to understand what I am painting and what I am writing
now. I’ll explain: in painting as in writing I try to see strictly in
the moment in which I see—and not to see through the
memory of having seen in a past instant. The instant is this
one. The instant is of an imminence that takes my breath
away. The instant is in itself imminent. At the same time that I
live it, I burst into its passage into another instant.
That was how I saw the church portal that I painted. You
argued there was excessive symmetry. Let me explain: the
symmetry was the most accomplished thing I did. I lost the
fear of symmetry, then of the disorder of inspiration. You need
experience or courage to revalue symmetry, when one can
easily imitate the falsely asymmetric, one of the most mundane
originalities. My symmetry in the church portals is concentrated,
accomplished, but not dogmatic. It’s touched by the hope that
two asymmetries will meet in symmetry. That as a third
solution: synthesis. Perhaps that’s why the portals look
stripped-down, the delicateness of something lived and then
relived, and not a certain irresponsible boldness of those who
do not know. No, it’s not exactly calmness that you find there.
There is a tough fight for the thing that though corroded
remains standing. And in the denser colors there’s the lividity
of something crooked that nonetheless keeps on going. My
crosses have been bent crooked by centuries of mortification.
Are the portals already a herald of altars? The silence of the
portals. Their verdigris takes on a hue of something between
life and death, an intensity of dusk.
And in the quiet colors is steel and old bronze—and all
amplified by a silence of things lost and found on the ground
of a steep road. I feel a long road and dust until I reach the
resting-place of the painting. Even though the portals don’t
open. Or is the portal of the church already the church, and
when before it you have already arrived?
I struggle not to go beyond the portal. They are walls of a
Christ that is absent, but the walls are there and touchable—for
the hands also look.
I create the material before I paint it, and the wood becomes
as indispensable to my painting as it would be to a sculptor.
And the created material is religious: it has the weight of the
beams of a monastery. Compact, closed like a closed door. But
onto the portal openings were flayed, scratched out by
fingernails. And it’s through these openings that you see what
is inside a synthesis, inside the utopian symmetry. Coagulated
color, violence, martyrdom, are the beams that sustain the
silence of a religious symmetry.
But now I’m interested in the mystery of the mirror. I’m
looking for a way to paint it or to speak of it with the word.
But what is a mirror? The word mirror does not exist, only
mirrors exist, for a single one is an infinity of mirrors.
Somewhere in the world there must be a mine of mirrors.
Mirror is not something created but something born. You don’t
need many to have the sparkling and sleepwalking mine: two
are enough, and one reflects the reflection of what the other
reflected, in a trembling that is transmitted in an intense and
mute telegraphic message, insistent, liquidity in which you can
plunge a fascinated hand and pull it out dripping with the
reflections of that hard water that is the mirror. Like the seer’s
crystal ball, it drags me toward the void that for the seer is his
field of meditation, and in me the field of silences and silences.
And I can barely speak, with so much silence unfurling into
others.
Mirror? That crystallized void that has in itself enough space to
go ever ceaselessly forward: for mirror is the deepest space
that exists. And it is a magic thing: whoever has a broken
piece can go with it to meditate in the desert. Seeing oneself is
extraordinary. Like a cat whose fur bristles, I bristle when
faced with myself. From the desert I would also return empty,
illuminated and translucent, and with the same vibrating silence
of a mirror.
Its form doesn’t matter: no form manages to circumscribe and
alter it. Mirror is light. A tiny piece of mirror is always the
whole mirror.
Remove its frame or the lines of its edges, and it grows like
spilling water.
What is a mirror? It’s the only invented material that is
natural. Whoever looks at a mirror, whoever manages to see it
without seeing himself, whoever understands that its depth
consists of being empty, whoever walks inside its transparent
space without leaving the trace of his own image upon it—that
somebody has understood its mystery of thing. For that to
happen one must surprise it when it’s alone, when it’s hanging
in an empty room, without forgetting that the finest needle
before it can transform it into the simple image of a needle, so
sensitive is the mirror in its quality of lightest reflection, only
image and not the body. Body of the thing.
When painting it I needed my own delicateness in order not to
cross it with my own image, since a mirror in which I see
myself is already I, only an empty mirror is what the living
mirror is. Only a very delicate person can enter the empty
room where there is an empty mirror, and with such lightness,
with such absence of self, that his image leaves no mark. As a
prize, that delicate person will then have penetrated one of the
inviolable secrets of things: he saw the mirror itself.
And he discovered the enormous frozen spaces that it has in
itself, only interrupted by an occasional block of ice. Mirror is
cold and ice. But there is the sequence of darknesses inside
it—noticing this is a very rare moment—and one must be on
the lookout for days and nights, fasting from oneself, in order
to capture and surprise the sequence of darknesses it has
inside it. With colors of white and black I recaptured on the
canvas its tremulous luminosity. With the same black and white
I also recapture, with a cold shiver, one of its most difficult
truths: its frosty silence without color. One must understand the
violent absence of color of a mirror in order to recreate it, as
one would recreate the violent absence of taste of water.
No, I did not describe the mirror—I was the mirror. And the
words are they themselves, without a discursive tone.
I must interrupt to say that “X” is what exists inside me.
“X”—I bathe in that this. It’s unpronounceable. All I do not
know is in “X.” Death? death is “X.” But much life too for life
is unpronounceable. “X” that shakes within me and I fear its
pitch: it vibrates like the string of a cello, a tense string that
when plucked emits pure electricity, without melody. The
unpronounceable instant. An other sensibility is what becomes
aware of “X.”
I hope you live “X” so you experience the kind of creating
sleep that stretches out through the veins. “X” is neither good
nor bad. Always independent. But it only happens to whatever
has a body. Though immaterial, it needs our body and the
body of the thing. There are objects that are this complete
mystery of the “X.” Like whatever vibrates mute. The instants
are shards of “X” incessantly exploding. The excess of me
starts to hurt and when I am excessive I must give of myself
like the milk that if it cannot flow will burst the breast. I
release the pressure and return to natural size. The exact
elasticity. Elasticity of a supple panther.
A caged black panther. Once I looked a panther right in the
eye and she looked at me right in the eye. We transmuted.
That fear. I left completely darkened inside, the “X” uneasy.
Everything had happened beyond thought. I miss that terror
that exchanging glances with the black panther gave me. I
know how to terrorize.
Is “X” the breath of the it
? the cold radiating respiration of it
? Is “X” a word? The word only refers to a thing and is
always unreachable by me. Each of us is a symbol that deals
with symbols— everything a point of only reference to the real.
We desperately try to find an identity of our own and the
identity of the real. And if we understand ourselves through
the symbol that is because we have the same symbols and the
same experience of the thing itself: but reality has no
synonyms.
I am speaking to you in the abstract and wonder: am I a
cantabile aria? No, you cannot sing what I am writing you.
Why don’t I tackle a theme I could easily flush out? but no: I
slink along the wall, I pilfer the flushed-out melody, I walk in
the shadow, in that place where so many things go on.
Sometimes I drip down the wall, in a place never reached by
the sun. My maturing of a theme would already be a cantabile
aria—so let somebody else make another song—the song of the
maturing of my quartet. This is before the maturing. The
melody would be the fact. But what fact has a night that
happens entirely on a byway while we slept unaware of
anything? Where is the fact? My story is of a calm darkness,
of the root asleep in its strength, of the smell which has no
scent. And in none of this does the abstract exist. It is the
figurative of the unnameable. There is almost no flesh in this
quartet of mine. A shame that the word “nerves” is linked to
painful vibrations, otherwise it would be a quartet of nerves.
Dark strings that, when plucked, do not speak of “other
things,”they don’t change the topic—they are in and of
themselves, they surrender just as they are, without lie or
fantasy.
I know that after you read me it’s hard to reproduce my song
by ear, it’s not possible to sing it without having learned it by
heart. And how can you learn something by heart if it has no
story?
But you will recall something that also happened in the
shadow. You will have shared this first mute existence, you will
have, as in the calm dream of a calm night, have run with the
resin down the tree trunk. Afterwards you will say: I dreamt
nothing. Will that be enough? It will. And especially in that
primary existence there is a lack of error, and a tone of
emotion of someone who could lie but doesn’t. Is that enough?
It is.
But I also want to paint a theme, I want to create an object.
And that object will be—a wardrobe, for what is more
concrete? I must study the wardrobe before painting it. What
do I see? I see that the wardrobe looks penetrable because it
has a door. But when I open it, I see that penetration has
been put off: since inside is also a wooden surface, like a
closed door. Function of the wardrobe: to keep drag and
disguises hidden. Nature: that of the inviolability of things.
Relation to people: we look at ourselves in the mirror on the
inside of the door, we always look at ourselves in an
inconvenient light because the wardrobe is never in the right
place: awkward, it stands wherever it fits, always huge,
hunchbacked, shy and clumsy, unaware how to be more
discreet, for it has too much presence. A wardrobe is
enormous, intrusive, sad, kind.
But suddenly the door-mirror opens—and suddenly, in the
movement the door makes, and in the new composition of the
room in shadow, into that composition enter flask after flask of
glass of fleeting brightness.
Then I can paint the essence of a wardrobe. The essence that
is never cantabile. But I want to have the freedom to say
unconnected things as a deep way of touching you. Only the
erring attracts me, and I love the sin, the flower of the sin.
But what can I do if you are not touched by my defects,
whereas I loved yours. My candour was crushed underfoot by
you. You didn’t love me, only I know that. I was alone. Yours
alone. I write to no one and a riff is being made that doesn’t
exist. I unglued myself from me.
And I want disarticulation, only then am I in the world. Only
then do I feel right.
Do feel right. I in my loneliness am ready to explode. Dying
must be a mute internal explosion. The body can no longer
stand being a body. And what if dying had the taste of food
when you’re very hungry? And what if dying were a pleasure,
selfish pleasure?
Yesterday I was drinking coffee and heard the maid in the
laundry room hanging up clothes and singing a melody without
words. A kind of extremely mournful dirge. I asked her whose
song it was, and she replied: it’s just my own nonsense, it’s
nobody’s.
Yes, what I’m writing you is nobody’s. And this nobody’s
freedom is very dangerous. It is like the infinite that has the
color of air.
All this that I’m writing is as hot as a hot egg that you quickly
toss from one hand to the other and then back to the first in
order not to get burned—I once painted an egg. And now as
in painting I just say: egg and that is enough.
No, I was never modern. And this happens: when I think a
painting is strange that’s when it’s a painting. And when I
think a word is strange that’s where it achieves the meaning.
And when I think life is strange that’s where life begins. I take
care not to surpass myself. In all of this is great restraint. And
then I get sad just to rest. I even cry gently out of sadness.
Then I get up and start again. I just won’t tell you a story
now is because in that case it would be prostitution. And I’m
not writing to please you. Mainly myself. I have to follow the
pure line and keep my it uncontaminated.
Now I shall write you everything that comes into my mind with
the least possible amount of policing. Because I feel attracted to
the unknown. But as long as I have myself I won’t be alone.
It’s going to start: I’m going to grab the present in every
phrase that dies. Now:
Ah if I had known that it were like that I wouldn’t have been
born. Ah if I had known I wouldn’t have been born. Madness
borders the cruellest good sense. This is a brain tempest and
one sentence barely has anything to do with the next. I
swallow the madness that is no madness—it’s something else.
Do you understand me? But I’ll have to stop because I’m so
and so tired that only dying would release me from this
fatigue. I’m leaving.
I’m back. Now I’ll try once more to bring myself up to date
with whatever occurs to me in the moment—and this is how
I’ll create myself. It’s like this:
The ring that you gave me was glass and it broke and the
love ended. But sometimes in its place comes the beautiful hate
of those who loved and devoured one another. The chair there
in front of me is an object to me. Useless while I look at it.
Please tell me what time it is so I can know that I am living
in that time. I am finding myself: it’s deadly because only death
concludes me. But I bear it until the end. I’ll tell you a secret:
life is deadly. I’ll have to interrupt everything to tell you this:
death is the impossible and intangible. Death is just future to
such an extent that there are those who cannot bear it and
commit suicide. It’s as if life said the following: and there
simply was no following. Only the waiting colon. We keep this
secret mutely to conceal that every instant is deadly. The chair
object interests me. I love objects to the degree that they do
not love me. But if I don’t understand what I’m writing it’s not
my fault. I must speak because speaking saves. But I have no
word to say. What would a person say to himself in the
madness of sincerity? But it would be salvation. Though the
terror of sincerity comes from the part of the shadows that
connect me to the world and to the creating unconscious of
the world. Today is a night with many stars in the sky. It
stopped raining. I am blinded. I open my eyes wide and only
see. But the secret —that I neither see nor feel. Could I be
making here a true orgy of what’s behind thought? orgy of
words? The record player is broken. I look at the chair and
this time it’s as if it too looked and saw. The future is
mine—as long as I live. I see the flowers in the vase. They are
wild flowers and were born without being planted. They are
yellow. But my cook said: what ugly flowers. Just because it’s
hard to love Franciscan things. In the beyond of my thought is
the truth that is that of the world. The illogicality of nature.
What silence. “God” is of such an enormous silence that it
terrifies me. Who invented the chair? It takes courage to write
what comes to me: you never know what could come up and
scare you. The sacred monster died. In its place was born a
girl who lost her mother. I am very well aware I’ll have to
stop. Not for a lack of words but because those things and
especially those I only thought and didn’t write— cannot be
said. I’ll speak of what is called the experience. It’s the
experience of asking for help and that help being given.
Perhaps it was worth being born in order one day to implore
mutely and mutely to receive. I asked for help and it was not
refused. I then felt like a tiger with a deadly arrow buried in
its flesh and who was slowly circling the fearful people to find
out who would have the courage to come up and free it from
its pain. And then there is the person who knows that a
wounded tiger is only as dangerous as a child. And coming up
to the beast, unafraid to touch it, pulls out the embedded
arrow.
And the tiger? Can’t say thank you. So I sluggishly walk back
and forth in front of the person and hesitate. I lick one of my
paws and then, since it’s not the word that then matters, I
silently move off.
What am I in this instant? I am a typewriter making the dry
keys echo in the dark and humid early hours. For a long time
I haven’t been people. They wanted me to be an object. I’m
an object. An object dirty with blood. That creates other
objects and the typewriter creates all of us. It demands. The
mechanism demands and demands my life. But I don’t obey
totally: if I must be an object let it be an object that screams.
There’s a thing inside me that hurts. Ah how it hurts and how
it screams for help. But tears are missing in the typewriter that
I am. I’m an object without destiny. I am an object in whose
hands? such is my human destiny. What saves me is the
scream. I protest in the name of whatever is inside the object
beyond the beyond the thought-feeling. I am an urgent object.
Now—silence and slight amazement.
Because at five in the morning, today July 25th, I fell into a
state of grace.
It was a sudden sensation, but so gentle. The luminosity was
smiling in the air: exactly that. It was a sigh of the world. I
don’t know how to explain just as you can’t describe the dawn
to a blind man. It is unutterable what happened to me in the
form of feeling: I quickly need your empathy. Feel with me. It
was a supreme happiness.
But if you have known the state of grace you’ll recognise what
I’m going to say. I’m not referring to inspiration, which is a
special grace that so often happens to those who deal with art.
The state of grace of which I’m speaking is not used for
anything. It’s as if it came only for us to know that we really
exist and the world exists. In this state, beyond the calm
happiness that irradiates from people and things, there is a
lucidity that I only call weightless because everything in grace is
so light. It’s a lucidity of one who no longer needs to guess:
without effort, he knows. Just that: knows. Don’t ask me what,
because I can only reply in the same way: he knows.
And there’s a physical bliss to which nothing else compares.
The body is transformed into a gift. And you feel that it’s a
gift because you experience, right at the source, the suddenly
indubitable present of existing miraculously and materially.
Everything gains a kind of halo that is not imaginary: it comes
from the splendor of the mathematical irradiation of things and
of the memory of people. You start to feel that all that exists
breathes and exhales a most fine resplendence of energy. The
truth of the world, however, is impalpable.
It’s not even close to what I can barely imagine must be the
state of grace of the saints. I have never known that state and
cannot even guess at it. It is instead just the grace of a
common person turning suddenly real because he is common
and human and recognizable.
The discoveries in this sense are unutterable and
incommunicable. And unthinkable. That is why in grace I stayed
seated, quiet, silent. It’s like in an annunciation. Not being
however preceded by angels. But it’s as if the angel of life
came to announce the world to me.
Then I slowly emerged. Not as if I had been in a trance—
there’s no trance—you emerge slowly, with the sigh of one who
had everything just as the everything is. It’s also already a sigh
of longing. Since having experienced gaining a body and a soul,
you want more and more. No use wanting: it only comes
when it wants and spontaneously.
I wanted to make that happiness eternal through the
intermediary of the objectification of the word. Right afterwards
I went to look up in the dictionary the word beatitude which I
hate as a word and saw that it means spasm of the soul. It
speaks of calm happiness—I would however call it transport or
levitation. Nor do I like how the dictionary continues: “of one
absorbed in mystical contemplation.” That’s not true: I wasn’t
meditating in any way, there was no religiosity in me. I’d just
had breakfast and was simply living sitting there with a
cigarette burning in the ashtray.
I saw when it started and took me. And I saw when it started
growing faint and ended. I’m not lying. I hadn’t taken any
drug and it wasn’t a hallucination. I knew who I was and who
others were.
But now I want to see if I can capture what happened to me
by using words. As I use them I’ll be destroying to some
extent what I felt— but that’s inevitable. I’m going to call what
follows “On the edge of beatitude.” It starts like this, nice and
slow:
When you see, the act of seeing has no form—what you see
sometimes has form and sometimes doesn’t. The act of seeing
is ineffable. And sometimes what is seen is also ineffable. And
that’s how it is with a certain kind of thinking-feeling that I’ll
call “freedom,” just to give it a name. Real freedom—as an act
of perception—has no form. And as the true thought thinks to
itself, this kind of thought reaches its objective in the very act
of thinking. By that I don’t mean that it either vaguely or
gratuitously is. It so happens that the primary thought—as an
act of thought—already has a form and is more easily
transmitted to itself, or rather, to the very person who is
thinking it; and that is why—because it has a form—it has a
limited reach. Whereas the thought called “freedom” is free as
an act of thought. It’s so free that even to its thinker it seems
to have no author.
The true thought seems to have no author.
And beatitude has that same quality. Beatitude starts in the
moment when the act of thinking has freed itself from the
necessity of form. Beatitude starts at the moment when the
thinking-feeling has surpassed the author’s need to think—he no
longer needs to think and now finds himself close to the
grandeur of the nothing. I could say of the “everything.” But
“everything” is a quantity, and quantity has a limit in its very
beginning. The true incommensurability is the nothing, which
has no barriers and where a person can scatter their
thinking-feeling.
This beatitude is not in itself religious or secular. And none of
this necessarily has any bearing on the issue of the existence
or non-existence of a God. What I’m saying is that the thought
of the man and the way this thinking-feeling can reach an
extreme degree of incommunicability— that, without sophism or
paradox, is at the same time, for that man, the point of
greatest communication. He communicates with himself.
Sleeping brings us very close to this empty and yet full
thought. I’m not talking about the dream, which, in this case,
would be a primary thought. I’m talking about sleeping.
Sleeping is abstracting yourself and scattering into the
nothingness.
I also want to tell you that after the freedom of the state of
grace also comes the freedom of the imagination also happens.
At this very moment I am free.
And beyond the freedom, beyond the certain void I create the
calmest of repeating musical waves. The madness of free
invention. Do you want to see it with me? Landscape where
this music happens? air, green stems, the spread-out sea,
silence of a Sunday morning. A slender man with only one
foot has one great transparent eye in the middle of his
forehead. A feminine entity slinks up on all fours, says in a
voice that seems to come from another space, voice that
sounds not like the first voice but in echo of a primary voice
that was never heard. The voice is awkward, euphoric and
says by force of the habit of a past life: would you like some
tea? And doesn’t wait for a reply. She grabs a slim ear of
golden wheat, and puts it between her toothless gums and
pads away on all fours with her eyes open. Eyes immobile as
the nose. She needs to move her whole boneless head to look
at an object. But what object? The slender man meanwhile has
fallen asleep on his foot and let his eye fall asleep without
however closing it. Letting your eye fall asleep is about not
wanting to see. When it doesn’t see, it sleeps. In the silent eye
the plain is reflected in a rainbow. The air is marvellous. The
musical waves start again. Someone looks at their nails. There’s
a sound in the distance going: psst, psst! . . . But the
man-with-just-one-foot could never imagine that they are calling
him. A sound starts up from the side, like the flute that always
seems to play from the side —a sound starts up from the side
that crosses the musical waves without a tremor, and repeats
so long that it ends up carving out the rock with its
uninterrupted dripping. It’s a highly elevated sound, without
friezes. A lament that’s happy and measured and sharp like
the non-strident and sweet sharpness of a flute. It’s the highest
and happiest note that a vibration can give. No man on earth
could hear it without going mad and starting to smile forever.
But the man standing on his only foot—sleeps upright. And the
feminine being stretched out on the beach isn’t thinking. A new
character crosses the deserted plain and disappears limping.
You hear: psst; psst! And no one is called.
Now the scene my freedom created is over.
I’m sad. An uneasiness that comes because the ecstasy doesn’t
fit into the life of the days. Sleep should follow the ecstasy to
attenuate its vibration of echoing crystal. The ecstasy must be
forgotten.
The days. I got sad because of the diurnal light of steel in
which I live. I breathe the smell of steel in the world of the
objects.
But now I want to say things that comfort me and that are a
little free. For example: Thursday is a day transparent as an
insect’s wing in the light. Just as Monday is a compact day.
Ultimately, far beyond thought, I live from these ideas, if ideas
is what they are. They are sensations that transform into ideas
because I must use words. Even just using them mentally. The
primary thought thinks with words. The “freedom” frees itself
from the slavery of the word.
And God is a monstrous creation. I fear God because he is
too total for my size. And I also feel a kind of modesty toward
Him: there are things of mine that not even He knows. Fear?
I know a she who is terrified by butterflies as if they were
supernatural. And the divine part of butterflies is terrifying
indeed. And I know a he who shivers in horror before
flowers—he thinks that flowers are hauntingly delicate like a sigh
of nobody in the dark.
I am the one listening to the whistling in the dark. I who am
sick with the human condition. I revolt: I no longer want to be
a person. Who? who has mercy on us who know about life
and death where an animal I envy profoundly—is unconscious
of its condition? Who takes pity on us? Are we abandoned?
given over to despair? No, there must be a possible
consolation. I swear: there must be. What I don’t have is the
courage to say the truth that we know. These are forbidden
words.
But I denounce. I denounce our weakness, I denounce the
maddening horror of dying—and I respond to all this infamy
with—exactly this that now will be written—and I respond to all
this infamy with joy. Purest and lightest joy. My only salvation
is joy. An atonal joy inside the essential it
. Doesn’t that make
sense? Well it must. Because it’s too cruel to know that life is
just one time and that we have no guarantee outside our faith
in shadows—because it’s too cruel, so I respond with the purity
of an untamable happiness. I refuse to be sad. Let us be
joyful. Whoever isn’t afraid to be joyful and to experience even
a single time the mad and profound joy will have the best part
of our truth. I am—despite everything oh despite
everything—am being joyful in this instant-now that passes if I
don’t capture it in words. I am being joyful in this very instant
because I refuse to be defeated: so I love. As an answer.
Impersonal love, it love, is joy: even the love that doesn’t work
out, even the love that ends. And my own death and that of
those we love must be joyful, I don’t yet know how, but they
must be. That is living: the joy of the it. And to settle for
that not as one defeated but in an allegro con brio.
As a matter of fact I don’t want to die. I rebel against “God.”
Let’s not die as a dare?
I’m not going to die, you hear, God? I don’t have the courage,
you hear? Don’t kill me, you hear? Because it’s a disgrace to
be born in order to die without knowing when or where. I’m
going to stay very happy, you hear? As a reply, as an insult. I
guarantee one thing: we are not guilty. And I have to
understand while I’m alive, you hear? because afterwards it will
be too late.
Ah this flash of instants never ends. My chant of the it never
ends? I’ll finish it deliberately by a voluntary act. But it will
keep going in constant improvisation, always and always
creating the present that is future.
This improvisation is.
Do you want to see how it goes on? Last night—it’s hard to
explain to you—last night I dreamed that I was dreaming.
Could it be like that after death? the dream of a dream of a
dream of a dream?
I’m a heretic. No, that’s not true. Or am I? But something
exists.
Ah living is so uncomfortable. Everything pinches: the body
demands, the spirit doesn’t stop, living is like being tired and
not being able to sleep—living is bothersome. You can’t walk
naked either in body or in spirit.
Didn’t I tell you that living pinches? Well, I went to sleep and
dreamed that I was writing you a majestic largo and it was
even more true than what I’m writing to you: it was without
fear. I forgot what I wrote in the dream, everything returned
to the nothing, returned to the Force of what Exists and that
is sometimes called God.
Everything comes to an end but what I’m writing to you goes
on. Which is good, very good. The best is not yet written. The
best is between the lines.
Today is Saturday and is made of the purest air, just air. I
speak to you as a profound exercise, and paint as a profound
exercise of me. What do I want to write now? I want
something calm and without fashions. Something like the
memory of a tall monument that seems taller because it is a
memory. But I want to have really touched the monument
along the way. I’m going to stop because it’s Saturday.
It’s still Saturday.
Whatever will still be later—is now. Now is the domain of now.
And as long as the improvisation lasts I am born.
And now suddenly after an evening of “who am I” and of
waking at one in the morning still in despair—now suddenly at
three in the morning I woke and met myself. I went to meet
myself. Calm, joyful, fullness without fulmination. Simply I am I.
And you are you. It is vast, and will endure.
What I’m writing you is a “this.” It won’t stop: it goes on.
Look at me and love me. No: you look at yourself and love
yourself. That’s right.
What I’m writing to you goes on and I am bewitched.


 
 
 
 
The Father...
Daddy's typewriter was tapping out tac-tac..tac-tac-tac... The
clock chimed brightly ting-ting... ting-ting... The silence dragged
out zzzzzzz. The wardrobe was saying what? clothes — clothes
— clothes. No, no. Between the clock, the typewriter and the
silence there was an ear listening out, large, flesh-pink and
dead. The three sounds were connected by the light of day
and by the rustling of tiny leaves on the tree as they joyfully
rubbed against each other.
Resting her head against the cold, shiny window-pane, she
looked into the neighbour's yard, at the great world of the
chickens-that-did-not-know-they-were-about-to-die. And as if it
were right under her nose, she could smell the warm, beaten
earth, so fragrant and dry, where she knew perfectly well, she
knew perfectly well that some worm or other lay squirming
before being devoured by the hen that humans were going to
eat.
There was a grand moment, motionless and quite hollow inside.
She opened her eyes wide and waited. Nothing happened.
Blank. But suddenly with a shudder they wound up the day
and they began to function once again, the typewriter tapping,
father's cigarette giving off smoke, silence, tiny leaves, plucked
chickens, brightness, things restored to life and as impatient as
a kettle on the boil. All that was missing was the ting-ting of
the clock which gave so much pleasure. She closed her eyes,
pretended to hear it chime, and to the rhythm of that
imaginary music, she went up on the tips of her toes. She
executed three dance steps, so light and ethereal.
Then suddenly she looked at everything with displeasure, as if
she had eaten far too much of that concoction. 'Hey, hey,
hey...', she murmured wearily and then thought to herself: what
will happen now now now? And in the fraction of time that
followed, nothing ever happened if she went on waiting for
something to happen if you get my meaning? She pushed
away this awkward thought, distracting herself with a movement
of her bare foot on the dusty wooden floor. She rubbed her
foot, looking sideways at her father, awaiting his impatient and
nervous smile. But nothing happened. Nothing. It's difficult to
suck in people like the vacuum cleaner does.
— Daddy, I've invented a poem.
— What is it called?
— The sun and I — Then almost at once she recited: 'The
chickens in the yard have gobbled two worms but I didn't see
them.'
— Really? What do you and the sun have to do with poetry?
She looked at him for an instant. He had not understood ...
— The sun is above my worms, Daddy, and I wrote my poem
and didn't see the worms... — Pause. — I can make up
another poem this very minute: 'Oh sun, come play with me.'
Here's a longer one:
'I saw a tiny cloud
poor little worm
I don't think she saw it.'
— Those are pretty verses, my little one, very pretty. How
does one compose such a charming poem?
— It isn't difficult, you simply say it out loud.
She had already dressed her doll, she had already undressed
it, she had imagined it going to a party where it stood out
among all the other baby dolls. A blue car ran over Arlete's
body and killed her. Then the fairy appeared and her doll was
restored to life. The baby doll, the fairy, the blue car were
none other than Joana, otherwise the game would be rather
dull. She always found some means of casting herself in the
main role as some turn of events highlighted one or other of
the characters. She took the game seriously, working in silence,
her arms hanging at her sides. She didn't need to get close to
Arlete in order to play with her. Even from a distance she
possessed things.
She amused herself with the paper cut-outs. She looked at
them for a moment and each cut-out was a pupil. Joana was
the teacher. The one good, the other bad. Yes, yes, and so
what? And now now now? And nothing ever happened if she...
that's right.
She invented a little man the size of her index finger, with long
trousers and a bow tie. She carried him in the pocket of her
school uniform. The little man was a real gem, a diamond in a
cravat, he had a deep voice and would say from inside her
pocket: 'Your Royal Highness Joana, pray lend me your ear
for one moment. I beseech you to interrupt your constant
labours just for one moment?' And then he declared: 'I am at
your service, dear Princess. Whatever you command I am
prepared to do.'
— Daddy, what can I do?
— Go and read your books.
— I've read them.
— Go and play then.
— I have been playing.
— Then don't bother me.
She twirled round and came to a halt, watching without
curiosity the walls and ceiling as they went round and fell
apart. She walked on tiptoe, only treading on the dark
floorboards. She closed her eyes and moved forward, her
hands outstretched, until she bumped into some piece of
furniture. Between her and the objects there was something,
but when she caught that thing in her hand like a fly and
then looked — however much care she took not to let
anything escape -all she found was her own hand, rosy and
disheartened. Yes, I know it was air, I know it was air! But
that didn't help, that didn't explain anything. This was one of
her secrets. She would never permit herself to confide, even to
daddy, that she was unable to catch 'the thing'. Everything that
really mattered was precisely what she found herself unable to
confide. She only talked nonsense to people. When she told
Ruth, for example, some of her secrets, she became furious
with Ruth. The best thing was surely to keep one's mouth
shut. Another thing: if she felt some pain and she looked at
the hands of the clock while that pain was troubling her, she
would then notice that the minutes counted on the clock were
passing while the pain went on hurting. Or else, even when it
didn't hurt her in the slightest, if she stood in front of the
clock staring at it, what she was not feeling was also greater
than the minutes counted on the clock. Now, when she
experienced some happiness or rage, she would run to the
clock and observe the seconds in vain.
She went to the window, traced a cross on the window-sill and
spat out in a straight line. If she were to spit once more —
now she would have to wait until night-time — the disaster
could be avoided and God would be so good to her, but so
good that... that what?
— Daddy, what can I do?
— I've already told you: go and play and leave me in peace!
— But I've been playing already, honestly.
Daddy smiled:
— But there's no end to playing...
— Yes there is.
— Make up another game.
— I don't want to play or read my books.
— What do you want to do then?
Joana thought carefully:
— I can't think of anything...
— Do you want to fly? her father asked her, his mind
elsewhere.
— No, replies Joana. Pause. — What can I do?
This time Daddy explodes.
— Go and knock your head against the wall!
She goes off, twisting her lank hair into a plait. Never never
never yes yes, she sings in a low voice. She has learned to
plait her hair just recently. She goes to her little table where
she keeps her books, plays with them, glancing at them from
afar. Housewife husband children, green is for man, white is
for woman, red could be son or daughter. Is 'never' man or
woman? Why is 'never' neither son nor daughter? And what
about 'yes'? Oh, there were so many things that were quite
impossible. She could spend whole afternoons just thinking. For
example: who uttered for the very first time this word 'never'?
Daddy finishes his work and goes off to find her sitting in a
chair and weeping.
— What's this, child? — he lifts her into his arms, calmly
examining her little face, flushed and mournful.
— What's this?
— I've nothing to do.
Never never yes yes. Everything was like the noise of the tram
before dozing off, until one feels a little frightened and falls
asleep. The mouth of the typewriter had closed like that of an
old woman, but something was pressing on her heart like the
noise of the tram: only she was not about to go to sleep. It
was Daddy's embrace. Her father muses for an instant. But no
one can do anything for others, we can only help ourselves.
The child is so restless, so thin and precocious... Her breathing
comes in bursts, she moves her head back and forth. A tiny
egg, that's it, a tiny, living egg. What is to become of Joana?
Joana's Day
The certainty that I'm heading for evil, thought Joana.
What else could that feeling be of restrained force, ready to
explode into violence, that urge to use it with her eyes shut, all
of it, with the unbridled confidence of a wild beast? Was it in
evil alone that one could breathe without fear, accepting the
atmosphere and one's lungs? Not even pleasure could give me
as much satisfaction as evil, she thought with surprise. She
could feel within herself the presence of a perfect animal, full of
inconsistencies, of egoism and vitality.
She remembered her husband who probably ignored this
aspect of her nature. She tried to recall the appearance of
Otávio. But the moment she sensed that he had left the house,
she became transformed, absorbed in herself and, as if she
had simply been interrupted by him, she slowly continued to
live the thread of childhood, she forgot him and went from
room to room completely alone. From the peaceful
neighbourhood, from the distant houses, there came no sound.
And now that she was free, she herself didn't know what she
was thinking.
Yes, she could feel within herself the presence of a perfect
animal. She resisted the idea of unleashing this animal one day.
Perhaps for fear of causing some embarrassment or because
she was afraid of some revelation... No, no — she repeated to
herself- one mustn't be afraid of being creative. Deep down,
the animal probably repelled her because she still felt anxious
to please and to be loved by someone as powerful as her
dead aunt. Even if only to humiliate her afterwards and disown
her without giving it another thought. For the best saying, as
well as being the most recent was: goodness makes me want
to vomit. Goodness was lukewarm and weak, it stank of raw
meat that had been lying around for a long time without,
however, becoming completely rotten. It was freshened up from
time to time, seasoned sufficiently to preserve it, a lump of
lukewarm, stagnating meat.
One day, when she was still unmarried and her aunt was still
alive, she had watched a man gorging himself with food. She
had watched his bulging eyes, bright and stupid, anxious to
savour every morsel. And his hands, his hands. One of them
holding the fork embedded in a piece of bleeding meat — not
lukewarm and inert, but intensely alive, ironic, and immoral —
the other hand twitching on the tablecloth, clawing it nervously
in his eagerness to consume another mouthful. The legs under
the table beat time to some inaudible tune, satanic music, of
sheer uncontrolled violence. The savage cruelty, the richness of
his colour... Crimson on the lips and around the nostrils, pale,
bluish tinges under his tiny eyes. Joana had shuddered in
horror confronting her miserable cup of coffee. But later she
would find it impossible to say whether it had been out of
fascination or desire. Almost certainly out of both. She knew
that the man was a force to be reckoned with. She felt that
she could never bring herself to eat like him, she was
abstemious by nature, but the spectacle disturbed her. She was
also moved when she read those terrifying tales of tragedy
where wickedness was as chilling and intense as bathing in ice.
As if she were watching someone drink water only to discover
that she was suffering from thirst, a deep and ancient thirst.
Perhaps it was only her need for life: she was living less than
she might and imagined her thirst pleading for inundations.
Perhaps just a few mouthfuls... Ah, that will teach you a lesson,
that will teach you a lesson, her aunt used to say: never to go
in front, never to steal before knowing that what you aim to
steal isn't honestly reserved for you some- where. Or isn't it?
Stealing makes everything so much more worthwhile. The taste
of evil- chewing crimson, devouring sweetened fire.
Not to blame myself. To seek the basis of egoism: all that I
am not is of no interest to me, it is impossible to exceed
oneself — meanwhile I surpass myself even without delirium, I
am more than my almost normal self— I possess a body and
all that I might do is the continuation of my beginning; if the
civilization of the ancient Mayas doesn't interest me, it's because
I have nothing inside me that may be connected with its
bas-reliefs;. I accept everything that comes from me because I
have no perception of the causes and I may be treading
unawares on what is vital; that is my greatest humility, she
surmised.
The worst thing of all is that she could obliterate all her
thoughts. Once erected, her thoughts were statues in the
garden and she passed through, taking a good look as she
went on her way.
She was happy that day and she also looked pretty. She was
even a little feverish. Why this romanticism: a little feverish?
But the truth is that I do have a little fever: bright eyes, this
strength and weakness, irregular heart-beats. When the light
breeze, the summer breeze, caught her body, she shivered all
over with cold and heat. And then she thought in a flash,
unable to pause and invent: It's because I'm still very young
and whenever they touch or do not touch me, I feel — she
reflected. To think now, for example, of fair streams. Precisely
because fair streams don't exist, do you understand? this is
how one escapes. Yes, but those streams gilded by the sun,
are fair after a fashion... In other words I didn't really imagine
it. Always the same fiasco: neither evil nor imagination. In the
first, in the final centre, the simple sensation without adjectives,
blind as a rolling stone. In her imagination, for it alone has the
power of evil, there is merely the vision enlarged and
transformed: beneath it, the impassive truth. One lies and
stumbles on the truth. Even in freedom, when she gladly chose
new paths, she recognized them afterwards. To be free was to
proceed in the end, and here once more is the path traced
out. She would only see what she already possessed within
herself. Now that the pleasure of imagining had been lost. And
the day when I wept? — there was also a certain temptation
to lie — I studied mathematics and suddenly sensed the
tremendous and chilling impossibility of the miracle. I looked
through that window and the only truth, the truth which I
could never tell that man to his face without his running away
from me, the only truth is that I am alive. Truly, I am alive.
Who am I? Well, that is asking too much. I am reminded of a
chromatic study by Bach and my intellect fails me. It is as cold
and pure as ice, yet one can sleep on it. I lose consciousness,
but no matter, I find the greatest serenity in hallucination. How
curious that I'm unable to say who I am. That is to say, I
know perfectly well, but I cannot bring myself to say it. Most
of all, I'm afraid of saying it, because the moment I try to
speak, not only do I fail to express what I feel, but what I feel
slowly transforms itself into what I am saying. Or at least, what
makes me act is not what I feel but what I say. I feel who I
am and the impression is lodged in the upper part of my
brain, on my lips — especially on my tongue — on the surface
of my arms and is also coursing inside me, deep down inside
my body, but where, precisely where, I cannot say. The taste is
grey, faintly tinged with red, touches of blue on the worn parts,
and it moves slowly like gelatine. Sometimes it becomes sharp
and wounds me, colliding with me. Very well, now let's think of
a blue sky, for example. But above all, where does this
certainty of being alive come from? No, no, I am not well. For
no one asks himself those questions and I... But the fact is
that it's enough to remain silent in order just to see beneath
all the realities, the one irreducible reality, that of existence. And
beneath all the doubts — the chromatic study — I know that
everything is perfect, for it has followed from scale to scale its
fatal path in relation to itself. Nothing escapes the perfection of
things, that is the history of all things. But this does not
explain why I am moved when Otávio coughs and puts his
hand to his chest, like this. Or when he smokes, and the ash
falls on his moustache, without his even noticing. Ah, pity is
what I feel at such moments. Pity is my way of loving. Of
hating and communicating. Pity is what sustains me against the
world, just as one person lives through desire and another
through fear. Pity for the things that happen without my
knowing. But I am tired, despite my happiness today, a
happiness which comes from who knows where, like that of a
summer dawn. I am tired, I am now desperately tired! Let us
weep together, softly. At having suffered, and let us continue to
suffer sweetly. Weary sorrow reduced to a tear. But now it's a
craving for poetry, this I confess, dear God. Let us sleep
holding hands. The world goes round and somewhere there
are things unknown to me. Let us sleep on God and on
mystery, a quiet, fragile ship floating on the sea, there you
have sleep.
Why was she so ardent and light, like the air that comes from
the stove when it's uncovered?
The day had been like any other, which might explain this
upsurge of life. She had woken up filled with the light of day,
inundated. Still in bed, she had thought about sand, the sea,
the time she drank sea-water at her aunt's house before the
old woman died, about feeling, especially about feeling. Lying
there, she waited for several moments and since nothing
happened she lived an ordinary day. She had not yet freed
herself from the desire-power-miracle that had been with her
since childhood. The formula had succeeded so many times: to
feel the thing without possessing it. All it required was that
everything should come to its assistance, leave it light and pure,
in a state of fasting in order to receive imagination. As difficult
as flying and, without anywhere to support one's feet, to
receive something extremely precious in one's arms, a child for
example. Even so, only at a certain point in the game did she
lose the feeling that she was telling lies — and she was afraid
of not being present in all her thoughts. She loved the sea and
could feel the bed-sheets covering her. The day advanced and
left her behind, alone.
Still lying in bed, she had remained silent, almost without
thinking, as sometimes happened. She superficially observed the
house filled with sunshine at that hour, the window-panes high
and shining as if they were light itself. Otávio had gone out.
There was no one in the house. And no one inside her so
that she was able to have thoughts as detached from reality as
she pleased. If I were to see myself there in the land of the
stars, I would remain only for myself. It was not night-time,
there were no stars, impossible to see oneself from such a
distance. Distracted, she suddenly remembered someone —
large teeth with great gaps, eyes without lashes — saying, with
every confidence of being original, yet sincere: my life is
tremendously nocturnal. Having spoken, this person remained
still, quiet, like an ox at night; from time to time the head
moved in a gesture without meaning or purpose only to go
back to being engulfed in stupidity. Filling the entire world with
fear. Ah, yes, the man belonged to her childhood and
connected with his memory there was a moist bunch of
enormous violets, trembling with luxuriance... Now fully awake,
should she so desire, Joana could relax a little, and relive her
entire childhood... The brief period spent with her father, the
removal to her aunt's house, the teacher instructing her how to
live, puberty, surfacing mysteriously, boarding school... her
marriage to Otávio... But all this was much briefer, a simple
look of surprise could exhaust all these facts.
Yes, she had a touch of fever. If sin existed, she had sinned.
Her whole life had been a mistake, she felt useless. Where was
the woman with the voice? Where were the women who were
merely female? And the continuation of what she had initiated
as a child? She had a touch of fever. The outcome of those
days when she had wandered to and fro, renouncing and
loving the same things a thousand times over. The outcome of
those nights, lived in darkness and silence, tiny stars twinkling
on high. The girl stretched out on the bed, her eye vigilant in
the waning light. The whitish bed swimming in the darkness.
Weariness creeping inside her body, lucidity fleeing the dusk.
Tattered dreams, awakening visions. Otávio alive in the other
room. And suddenly all the weariness of waiting concentrating
itself in one nervous, rapid movement of her body, the muffled
cry. Then coldness, and sleep.
 
... One Day...
One day her father's friend arrived from afar and embraced
him. When they sat down to dinner, Joana, bewildered and
contrite, saw a naked, yellow chicken lying on the table. Her
father and the man were drinking wine and the man kept
saying from time to time:
— I just can't believe you've got yourself a daughter...
Turning to Joana with a smile, her father said:
— I bought her in the shop on the corner...
Her father was happy, yet continued to look thoughtful as he
kneaded his bread into tiny balls. From time to time, he would
swallow a mouthful of wine. The man turned to Joana and
asked her:
— Did you know that the pig goes grunt-grunt-grunt?
Her father interrupted:
— You're really good at that, Alfredo... The man was called
Alfredo.
— Can't you see, her father continued, that the child is no
longer at an age to be playing at being a pig...
They both laughed and Joana joined in. Her father gave her
another chicken wing and she went on eating without any
bread.
— How does it feel to have a little daughter? the man asked,
still chewing.
Her father wiped his mouth with his napkin, leaned his head
sideways and replied smiling:
— At times it's like holding a warm egg in my hand.
Sometimes I feel nothing: a total loss of memory. Now and
then, I'm aware of having a child of my own, my very own.
— Missie, missie, bissie, lissie... the man sang, looking towards
Joana. What are you going to be when you grow up and
become a young lady and all the rest of it?
— As for all the rest of it, she doesn't have the faintest idea,
my dear fellow, her father declared, but if she won't get
annoyed with me, I'll tell you what she wants to be. She has
told me that when she grows up she's going to be a hero...
The man laughed, and laughed, and laughed. Suddenly he
stopped, held Joana by the chin and as long as he remained
there holding it, she couldn't chew her food:
— Surely you're not going to cry because your daddy has told
me your secret, little one?
Then they began to discuss things that must have happened
before she was born. At times, they were not even the kind of
thing that happens, but just words — also before she was
born. A thousand times she would have preferred there to be
rain because it would be so much easier to sleep without being
frightened of the dark. The two men went to get their hats
before going out; then she got up and tugged at her father's
jacket:
— Stay a little longer...
The two men looked at each other and for a second she
couldn't be certain whether they would stay or go. But when
her father and his friend put on a serious expression then
laughed together, she knew that they would stay. At least until
she was sleepy enough not to lie down without hearing rain,
without hearing people, or to be thinking of the rest of the
house, dark, empty and silent. They sat down and smoked.
The light began to twinkle in her eyes and next day, as soon
as she awakened, she would go and visit the neighbour's
backyard and take a look at the chickens because today she
had eaten roast chicken.
— I couldn't forget her, her father was saying. Not that I
spent all my time thinking of her. Now and then a thought,
like some memory to muse upon much later. Later it came,
but I was unable to give it serious consideration. There was
only that slight pang, without any pain, an ah! barely outlined,
a moment of reflection and then gone from my mind. She was
called... he glanced at Joana — she was called Elza. I even
remember saying to her: the name Elza makes me think of an
empty sack. She was slender, disdainful — you know what I
mean don't you? — intimidating. So quick and harsh in making
judgements, so independent and embittered that from our very
first meeting I accused her of being shrewish. Would you
believe it... She burst out laughing, then became solemn. At
that time, I found myself imagining what she would do at
night. For I didn't believe it possible that she would sleep. No,
she was never one to surrender. And even that sallow
complexion — fortunately the child has not inherited it — did
not look quite right with a nightdress ... She would spend the
night in prayer, her eyes fixed on the dark sky, keeping vigil
for someone. My memory was bad, I couldn't even remember
why I had called her a shrew. But my memory was not so
bad that I could forget her. I could still see her striding along
the beach, her expression sullen and remote. The oddest thing
of all, Alfredo, is that there couldn't have been any beach. Yet
that vision persisted and defied any explanation.
The man was smoking and reclining in his chair. Joana was
scoring the red hide on the armchair with her nail.
— I woke up early one morning with a fever. I can almost still
feel my tongue inside my mouth, hot, dry, as rough as a rag.
You know how I hate suffering, I'd rather sell my soul. Then I
found myself thinking about her. Incredible. I was already
thirty-two, unless I'm mistaken. I'd met her briefly at the age
of twenty. And in a moment of anguish, from among so many
friends — even you, for I didn't know where you were — at
that moment I thought of her. She was the devil...
His friend laughed:
— Yes, she is the devil...
— You can't imagine what she was like: I never saw anyone
with so much hatred for others, but real hatred and contempt
as well. And to be so good at the same time... dry but good.
Or am I wrong? I am the one who did not like that kind of
goodness: almost as if she were making a fool of me. However
I got used to it. She didn't need me. Nor I her, to be honest.
But we lived together. What I should still like to know, would
give anything to know, is what was on her mind all the time.
You would find me, as you now see me and know me, the
greatest fool compared to her. So you can imagine the
impression she made on the few miserable relatives I possess:
it was as if I had brought into their rosy and ample bosom —
do you remember, Alfredo? — they both laughed — it was as
if I had brought in some contagious virus, a heretic, I don't
know what... Who can tell? But even I prefer that this little
one shouldn't take after her. Or after me, for God's sake —
Fortunately, I have the impression that Joana will go her own
way...
— And then? the man rejoined.
— Then... nothing. She died as soon as possible.
Later the man said:
— Look, your daughter is almost asleep... The kindest thing
would be to put her to bed.
But she was not sleeping. She only had to half-close her eyes,
and let her head droop to one side, and it was almost as
good as if it were raining, with everything gently merging. So
that when she finally got into bed and pulled the sheet over
her she would be more accustomed to sleep, wouldn't feel the
darkness weighing on her bosom. Especially now that she was
frightened of Elza. But one cannot be frightened of one's own
mother. A mother was like a father. As her father carried her
along the passageway to the bedroom, she leaned her head
against him and caught the heavy odour that came from his
arms. She said without speaking: no, no, no... In order to
cheer herself up she thought: tomorrow, first thing tomorrow
I'm going to see the live chickens.
 
 
The last rays of sunlight flickered on the green branches
outside. The pigeons pecked at the loose earth. From time to
time, the schoolroom was invaded by the breeze and the
silence coming from the playground. Then everything became
lighter, the teacher's voice fluttered like a white flag.
— And he and his loved ones lived happily ever after — Pause
— the trees stirred in the yard, it was a summer's day. —
Write a summary of this story for our next lesson. Still
absorbed in the story, the children slowly dispersed, their eyes
vacant, their mouths wearing a smile of satisfaction.
— What do you get when you're happy? her voice was as
clear and sharp as an arrow. The teacher looked at Joana.
— Can you repeat the question... ?
Silence. The teacher smiled, arranging her books.
— Ask me once more, Joana, I didn't hear you the first time.
— I wanted to know: when you're happy what happens? What
comes afterwards? — the girl repeated stubbornly.
The woman looked at her in surprise.
— What an idea! I don't know what you're talking about, what
an idea! Ask me the same question with different words...
— To be happy is to get what?
The teacher turned crimson — you could never tell why she
turned crimson. She marked the register and dismissed the
class for recreation.
The porter came to summon the girl to the office. The teacher
was waiting there:
— Sit down... Have you been playing?
— Just a little...
— What do you want to be when you grow up?
— I don't know.
— Well, listen, I've also had an idea — she reddened.
— Take a piece of paper, write down the question you asked
me today and hold on to it. When you grow up, read it again.
— She looked at her. — Who knows? Perhaps one day, you
yourself will be able to reply somehow... — She lost her serious
expression, turned crimson — Or perhaps this isn't important
and, at least, you will enjoy yourself with...
— No.
— No what? — the teacher asked in surprise.
— I don't like enjoying myself, Joana said proudly. The teacher
had turned crimson again:
— Very well, off you go and play.
As Joana made a dash for the door, the teacher called her
back, by now flushed to the neck, her eyes lowered,
rummaging through the papers on her desk:
— Don't you find it strange... odd that I should ask you to
write down a question and hold on to it?
— No, she replied.
And returned to the playground.
 
Joana Takes a Stroll
I find it so relaxing, Joana explained to Otávio.
Just as the space surrounded by four walls has a specific
utility, created not so much by its being space, as by the fact
that it is surrounded by walls. Otávio transformed her into
something that was not her but Otávio himself and which
Joana received out of pity for both of them because both were
incapable of freeing themselves through love. Also because she
submissively accepted her own fear of suffering, her inability to
conduct herself beyond the frontier of revolt. Besides: how was
she to tie herself to a man without permitting him to imprison
her? How was she to prevent him from enclosing her body
and soul within his four walls? And was there some means of
acquiring things without those things possessing her?
The evening was naked and transparent, without beginning or
end. Birds, agile and black, darted sharply through the pure
air, they flew so swiftly that no human eye could accompany
their flight. In the far distance, the mountain hovered, massive
and dense. There were two ways of looking at it: first, by
imagining that it was remote and huge; second by imagining
that it was small and within reach. But in any event, a stupid
mountain, brown and solid. How she loathed nature at times.
Without knowing why, it struck her that this last reflection,
associated with the mountain, concluded something, and banging
on the table with the palm of her hand, she thought: That's it!
That grey and greenish thing extended inside Joana like a
recumbent body, thin and harsh, right inside her, completely
dry, like a smile without saliva, like strained eyes in need of
sleep, that thing affirmed itself before the impassive mountain.
What she could not grasp with her hand was now glorious,
elevated and free, and it was hopeless to try and summarize it:
pure air, a summer's evening. For there was certainly more
than this. A hollow victory over the lush trees, the aimless
existence of all things. Oh, God. This, yes, this: were God to
exist, surely He would abandon that world immediately, too
clean by far, like a house on a Saturday, quiet, not a speck of
dust anywhere, smelling of soap. Joana smiled. Why did a
house that had been polished and cleaned leave her feeling lost
as if she were in a monastery, disconsolate, wandering through
corridors? And there were many other things she observed. If
she applied ice to her liver, she was pervaded by remote,
sharp sensations, by luminous, fleeting ideas, and if she were
then to speak, she would say, sublime, with outstretched hands,
perhaps with her eyes closed:
— Then I find it so relaxing, she repeated. She felt like a
withered branch, stuck in mid-air. Brittle, covered with peeling
bark. Perhaps she might be thirsty, but there was no water
nearby. And above all, the suffocating certainty that if a man
were to embrace her at that moment she would not feel a
gentle sweetness in her nerves, but lemon-juice causing her to
smart, her body like wood near the fire, warped, split,
desiccated. She could not reassure herself by saying: this is just
an interval, life will come afterwards like a tidal wave of blood,
washing me, dampening the scorched wood. She could not
deceive herself because she knew that she was also living and
that those moments were the climax of something awkward, of
a painful experience for which she should be grateful: almost
as if she were experiencing time outside herself, quietly
withdrawing.
— I've noticed that you like walking, Otávio remarked, gathering
a twig. — Besides, you liked going for a stroll even before we
married.
— Yes, that's quite true, she replied.
She could offer him any thought and so create a new
relationship between them. This is what pleased her most in
her dealings with others. She was under no obligation to follow
the past, and with a word she could invent a way of life. If
she were to say: I'm three months pregnant, that's it!
something would exist between them. Even though Otávio was
not particularly stimulating. With him the most likely possibility
was to link oneself to what had already taken place. Even so,
beneath that gaze of his imploring 'save me, save me', she
opened her hand from time to time and allowed a little bird to
take sudden flight. But sometimes, perhaps because of the
nature of what she said, no bridge was created between them.
On the contrary, a gap opened up. 'Otávio — she suddenly
said to him — has it ever occurred to you that a dot, a single
dot without dimensions is the maximum of solitude? A dot
cannot even rely on itself, from one moment to the next, it
stands by itself.' As if she had thrown a red-hot coal at her
husband, the phrase leaped from one side to the other, slipped
from her hands until he rid himself of her with another
phrase, cold as ashes, ashes to cover that interval: It's raining,
I'm hungry, it's a fine day. Perhaps because she did not know
how to play. But she loved him, for that way he had of
gathering twigs.
She inhaled the clear, tepid air of evening, and that thing inside
her, pleading for water, remained tense and rigid like someone
waiting with eyes blindfolded for the shot to ring out.
Night came, and she continued to breathe with the same sterile
rhythm. But as dawn gently lit up the bedroom, things
emerged fresh from the shadows, she felt the new morning
insinuating itself between the sheets and opened her eyes. She
sat on the bed. Inside her it was as if there were no death,
as if love could dissipate it, as if eternity meant renewal.
 
... The Aunt...
The journey took ages and from the distant woods came the
pungent smell of damp scrub.
It was early morning and Joana had barely had time to wash
her face. The housemaid at her side amused herself by reading
out the advertisements on the tram. Joana was reclining with
her right temple resting on the back of the seat and she
permitted herself to be lulled by the consoling sound of the
wheels, drowsily transmitted by the wood. The ground sped
away beneath her lowered eyes, rapid, grey, lined with swift
and fleeting stripes. Were she to open her eyes she would see
each stone, she would dispel the mystery. But she half closed
them and had the impression that the tram was going faster
and that the fresh, salty, dawn breeze was growing stronger.
There was something odd about the cake she had eaten with
her coffee, it was dark — tasted of wine and cockroaches —
cake which they had persuaded her to eat with so much
affection and pity that she hadn't had the heart to refuse. It
now weighed heavily on her stomach and brought a sadness
to her body which attached itself to that other sadness -.
something immovable behind the curtain — with which she had
slept and awoken.
— Tramping over this sand is hard work, the housemaid
complained.
She crossed the stretch of sand which led to her aunt's house,
heralding the beach. Beneath the grains of sand, there sprouted
thin, dark grasses which wriggled vigorously to the smooth,
white surface. A strong wind blew in from the invisible sea,
bringing salt, sand, the languid sound of the waters, it
entangled their skirts between their legs, furiously licking the
girl's skin and that of the woman accompanying her.
— This is awful, the maid muttered between clenched teeth.
An even stronger gust lifted her skirt to her face, exposing her
dark, muscular thighs. The coconut-palms writhed in
desperation and the light, at once overcast and fierce, reflected
itself on the beach and in the sky, without any trace of the
sun so far. Dear God, what had happened to things?
Everything was calling out: no! no!
Her aunt's house was a refuge where neither wind nor light
penetrated. The woman sat down with a sigh in the sombre
waiting-room, where, amidst the heavy, dark furniture, the
smiling portraits of men in frames cast a gentle glow. Joana
remained standing, scarcely inhaling that lukewarm odour which
seemed sweet and musty after the sharp tang of the sea. The
odour of mildew and tea sweetened with sugar.
The door leading into the house finally opened and her aunt,
dressed in a house-coat with a bold floral pattern, rushed to
embrace her. Before she could move in self-defence, Joana
found herself being buried between those two mounds of soft,
warm flesh which quivered with every sob. Trapped between
those breasts and plunged into darkness, she could hear her
aunt weeping as if through a pillow:
— My poor little orphan!
She could feel her face being drawn back from her aunt's
bosom by those plump hands and for a second she was
carefully scrutinized. Her aunt passed from one gesture to
another without any transition, in quick abrupt stages. A fresh
outburst of weeping exploded in her body and Joana received
anguished kisses on her eyes, her mouth, her neck. Her aunt's
tongue and mouth were soft and warm like those of a dog.
Joana closed her eyes for an instant, swallowed the nausea
and the dark cake which were heaving inside her stomach,
causing her to shudder from head to foot. Her aunt pulled out
a large, crumpled handkerchief and blew her nose. The
housemaid remained seated, looking at the portraits, her legs
sprawled out, her mouth wide open. The cleavage between the
aunt's breasts was deep. She could have put her hand in there
as if she were dipping into a bag and pulling out some
surprise, an animal, a casket, whatever. Her breasts expanded
with every sob, bulged out, and from the kitchen came the
smell of beans cooked with garlic. Somewhere in the house,
someone must be drinking great mouthfuls of olive oil. Those
breasts could bury someone!
— Let me go! — Joana screamed, stamping her foot on the
ground, her eyes dilated, her body trembling.
Her aunt leaned against the piano, stunned. The housemaid
said: Leave her alone, she's tired. Joana was gasping for
breath, her face a deathly white. She passed her darkened eyes
over the room, felt she was being pursued. The walls were
solid, she was trapped, trapped! A man in one of the portraits
was watching her from behind his moustache and her aunt's
breasts were in danger of spilling over her, melted into fat. She
pushed the heavy door and fled.
A gust of wind and sand entered the hall, lifted the curtains,
brought a breath of air. Through the open door, her
handkerchief suppressing her sobs and her dismay — such a
terrible disappointment — the aunt caught a fleeting glimpse of
her niece's thin, bare legs scampering and scurrying between
heaven and earth, until they disappeared in the direction of the
beach.
Using the back of her hands, Joana wiped her face which was
wet with kisses and tears. She breathed more deeply, still felt
the insipid taste of that warm saliva, the cloying fragrance that
came from her aunt's bosom. Unable to control her feelings
any longer, anger and revulsion surfaced in violent waves and,
leaning over a cavity in the rocks, she threw up, her eyes shut
and tight, her body painful and vindictive.
The wind was now licking her with force. Pale and fragile,
breathing gently, she could feel it salty and playful, pervading
and penetrating her entire body, reviving her. She half opened
her eyes. Down there below, the sea shone in waves of
copper, stretched out, deep, opaque, serene. It came dense and
rebellious, rising in spirals. Then it extended itself ... spreading
itself over the peaceful sands like a living body. The sea — she
said in a whisper, her voice hoarse.
She climbed down from the rocks, walked unsteadily along the
solitary beach until she felt the water on her feet. Crouching
down, her legs shaking, she drank a little sea-water. And there
she lingered, resting. From time to time, she half closed her
eyes, kept them level with the sea and she faltered, the vision
was so sharp -just that long, green line, attaching her eyes to
the water ad infinitum. The sun broke through the clouds
and the glints of light that sparkled on the waters were tiny
flares going in and out. The sea, beyond the waves, watched
from afar, silent, without tears, without breasts. Mighty, mighty.
Mighty, she smiled. And, suddenly, without any warning, she
felt something powerful inside her, something strange which
caused her to tremble a little. But it was neither cold nor sad,
it was some mighty thing which came from the sea, which
came from the taste of salt in her mouth, and from her, from
her herself. It was not sadness, but happiness close to horror...
Every time she looked at the sea and its tranquil brilliance, she
felt a sudden tightening then slackening throughout her body,
around her waist and her bosom. She didn't really know if she
should laugh for it was no laughing matter. On the contrary,
oh, on the contrary, behind that thing lay the events of
yesterday. She covered her face with her hands, almost
ashamed, as she waited, feeling the heat of her laughter and
her exhalation as it was sucked in once more. The water
trickled over her feet which were now bare, gurgling between
her toes, escaping as clear, as clear, as some transparent
animal. Transparent and alive... She felt an urge to drink it, to
bite it slowly. She caught it with cupped hands. The tiny
quiescent lake glistened calmly in the sun, became warm,
trickled away, escaped. The sand absorbed it quickly, quickly,
went on absorbing it as if it had never experienced a trickle of
water. She wet her face, passed her tongue over the empty,
salty palm of her hand. The salt and the sun were like tiny,
shining arrows which appeared here and there, stinging,
stretching the skin of her wet face. Her happiness increased,
gathered in her throat like a sack of air. But it was now a
solemn happiness, with no desire for laughter. It was a
happiness close to tears, dear God. Gradually, the thought
occurred to her. Without fear, no longer grey and tearful, but
naked and silent beneath the sun like the white sand. Daddy is
dead. Daddy is dead. She breathed slowly. Now she really
knew that Daddy had died. Now, beside the sea where the
sparkling light was a shower of fishes made out of water. Her
father had died just as the sea was deep. Suddenly she
understood. She felt that her father had died just as one
cannot see the bottom of the sea. She had not been defeated
by her grief. She understood that her father had died. Nothing
more. And her sadness was exhausting, heavy, without hatred.
She carried that exhaustion with her as she walked along that
endless beach. She looked at her dark, slender feet like twigs
gathered from the quiescent whiteness where they sank and
lifted rhythmically, as if breathing. She walked and walked and
there was nothing to be done: her father had died.
She lay prostrate on the sand, her hands protecting her face,
leaving only a tiny gap for air. It was starting to get dark, so
dark, and little by little there emerged circles and red stains,
round, quivering bubbles, growing and diminishing. The grains
of sand pricked her skin, became embedded. Even with her
eyes shut, she could sense that on the beach the waves were
being sucked in rapidly, so rapidly, by the sea, the waves, too,
with lowered eyelids. Then they gently returned, to the palms
of her open hands, her body completely relaxed. It was
consoling to hear that sound. I am a person. And many things
were about to follow. What? Whatever might happen would
depend on her. Even if no one should understand: she would
think of something and then find herself unable to describe it
accurately. Especially when it came to thinking, everything was
impossible. For example, sometimes an idea occurred to her
and, surprised, she would reflect: why didn't I think of this
before? It wasn't the same thing as suddenly seeing a tiny
gash in the table and saying: Now then, I didn't notice that
before! It wasn't... A thing thought did not exist before being
thought. Like this, for instance: Gustavo's fingerprints... What
was being thought became something thought. Furthermore: not
all things thought came into existence from that moment
onwards... For if I say: Auntie is having lunch with Uncle, I
don't bring anything to life. Or even if I decide I'm going for a
stroll; that's fine, I go for a stroll... and nothing exists. But if I
say, for example: flowers on the grave, there you have
something which did not exist before I thought of flowers on a
grave. It's the same with music. Why didn't she play on her
own all the pieces of music that existed? — She looked at the
open piano — all the pieces of music were stored inside there..
.Her eyes widened, grown dark and mysterious. 'Everything,
everything.' That was when she began to tell lies. For she was
a person who had already begun. All of this was impossible to
explain, like that word 'never', neither masculine nor feminine.
But even so, didn't she know when to say 'yes'? She knew.
Oh, she knew more and more. For example, the sea. The sea
was immense. Just to think of the sea made her want to sink
into the sand, or to open her eyes wide, to stay there
watching, but then she found there was nothing to watch. At
her aunt's home, they would almost certainly spoil her with
sweets during the first few days. She would bathe in the blue
and white bathtub, once she was living in the house. And each
night, when it turned dark, she would slip on her nightdress
and go to bed. In the morning, coffee with milk and biscuits.
Her aunt always baked large biscuits. But without salt. Like
someone dressed in mourning watching from the tram. She
would dip her biscuit into the sea before eating it. She would
take a bite, then dash home to swallow a mouthful of coffee.
And that is how she would go on. She would play in the yard,
where there were sticks and bottles. But where, above all, there
was that old chicken-coop without any chickens. The place
smelled of lime and excrement and of things drying out. But
she could sit in there, right down on the ground, looking at
the soil. Soil formed from so many bits and pieces that it gave
you a headache trying to guess just how many. The
chicken-coop had netting and everything, and this would be
her home. And there was still her uncle's farm which she
scarcely knew, but where she would spend her holidays from
now on. There were lots of nice things to look forward to,
weren't there? She buried her face in her hands. Oh, such
fear, such fear. But it wasn't only fear. It was like someone
who has finished something and says: Please, Miss, I've
finished. And the teacher says: Just sit there and wait for the
others. And you sit there quietly as if you were in church.
Inside a tall church and without saying a word. Those slender,
fragile saints. When you touch them they feel cold. Cold and
divine. And everything remains silent. Oh, such fear, such fear.
However, it was not simply fear. I don't have anything to do
and I don't know what to do. Like looking at something pretty,
a fluffy chick, the sea, a lump in one's throat. But it wasn't
only that. Open eyes blinking, and confused with the things
behind the curtain.
 
Joana's Pleasures
The freedom she often experienced did not come from lucid
reflections, but from a state that seemed to consist of
perceptions, much too organic to be expressed in thoughts.
Sometimes at the heart of that sensation there was the
glimmering of an idea which made her vaguely aware of her
species and colouring.
The state she slipped into when she murmured: eternity. The
very thought acquired the nature of eternity. It deepened as if
by magic and expanded, without any proper content or form,
but also without dimensions. She had the impression that if she
could manage to retain that sensation for a few more seconds
she would experience a revelation — effortlessly, like seeing the
rest of the world simply by leaning away from the earth and
out into space. Eternity was not only time, but something akin
to the deeply-rooted certainty of not being able to hold it in
one's body because of death; the impossibility of suppressing
eternity; just as an almost abstract feeling of absolute purity
was eternal. But the clearest suggestion of eternity stemmed
from the impossibility of knowing how many human beings
would succeed her own body, which would one day distance
itself from the present with the velocity of a shooting-star.
She defined eternity and explanations were inevitably born like
the pulsations of the heart. She would not change a single
word for they were her truth. They no sooner appeared,
however, than they became devoid of any logic. To define
eternity as a quantity greater than time and greater even than
the time the human mind can sustain thought, would not
permit her, even so, to perceive its duration. Its essential quality
was not to have any quantity, not to be measurable and
divisible because everything which could be measured and
divided had a beginning and an end. Eternity was not that
infinitely great quantity that exhausted itself; eternity was
succession.
Then Joana suddenly understood that the greatest beauty was
to be found in succession, that movement explained form —
there was something so elevated and pure when one cried out:
movement explains form! — and in succession one also
discovered sorrow because the body was much slower than the
movement of uninterrupted continuity. Imagination captured and
possessed the future of the present, while the body remained
at the beginning of the road, living in another rhythm, blind to
the experience of the spirit... Through these perceptions — by
means of them, Joana made something exist — she connected
with a happiness that was self-sufficient.
There were lots of pleasant sensations. To climb a mountain, to
linger on the summit and, without looking round, to feel the
presence of that conquered territory she had left behind, her
uncle's farm way off in the distance. The wind catching her
clothes, her hair. Her arms free, her heart closing and opening
savagely, but her face bright and serene beneath the sun. And
knowing, above all, that the earth beneath her feet was so
deep and secret that there was no need to fear the invasion of
understanding dissolving its mystery. This sensation had the
hallmark of glory.
Certain moments of music. Music belonged to the same
category as thought, both vibrated in the same movement and
species. It possessed the same quality of a thought so intimate
that upon hearing that music, the thought itself was revealed. A
thought so intimate that upon hearing someone repeat the
subtle nuances of those sounds, Joana found herself surprised,
as if she had been invaded and dispersed. She no longer even
heard the harmony once it was diffused — for then it was no
longer hers. Or even when she listened to it a number of
times, which destroyed the analogy: for her thought never
repeated itself, while music could be played over and over
again and sound exactly as before — thought was only equal
to music creating itself. Joana did not identify herself closely
with all the sounds. Only with those that were pure, and what
she loved here was neither tragic nor comic.
There was also much to see. Certain moments of seeing were
as valid as those 'flowers on a grave'. What one saw passed
into existence. Joana, however, was not expecting some vision
in a miracle announced by the Angel Gabriel. She was as
astonished at what she had already perceived, suddenly seeing
something for the first time, suddenly realizing that that
something was constantly alive. Like a barking dog outlined
against the sky. That was something apart that required no
further explanation... An open door swinging to and fro,
creaking in the evening silence... And suddenly, yes, there was
the real thing. An old portrait of someone whom you don't
know and are never likely to recognize because the portrait is
old or because the person in the portrait has turned to ashes
— this little distraction brought a moment of welcome respite.
Also a mast without a flag, erect and mute, fixed into position
on a summer's day — both the face and body blind. In order
to have a vision, the thing did not have to be sad or happy
or to manifest itself. It was enough to exist, preferably still and
silent, in order to feel its mark. Dear God, the mark of
existence... But this was not something to be pursued, since all
that existed, perforce existed... The vision, in fact, consisted in
surprising the symbol of things in the things themselves.
She found these discoveries confusing. But this also lent a
certain grace. How to clarify herself, for example, what long,
sharp lines did the mark clearly have? They were sharp and
thin. At a given moment they were nothing but lines, ending
up exactly as they had started. Interrupted, constantly
interrupted not because they were likely to come to an end,
but because no one could terminate them. The circles were
more perfect, less tragic, and did not move her sufficiently. A
circle was the work of man, completed before death, and God
Himself couldn't improve on that finish. While straight, thin, free
lines-were like thoughts.
There were other things that confused her. She remembered
Joana as a little girl looking out to sea: the tranquillity that
came from the eyes of an ox, the tranquillity that came from
that sprawling expanse of sea, from the sea's deep womb, from
the cat lying rigid on the pavement. All is one, all is one... she
had chanted. The confusion stemmed from the entwinement of
the sea, the cat and the ox with Joana herself. The confusion
also arose because she did not know whether she had
discovered 'all is one' when she was still a little girl standing
looking out to sea, or later, when she remembered those
moments. Meanwhile, the confusion didn't only confer a certain
grace, but also a sense of reality. It struck her that, if she
were to order and clearly explain what she had experienced,
she would have destroyed the essence of 'all is one'. In her
confusion, she was unwittingly truth itself, which probably gave
her a greater capacity for life than knowledge of life. This truth,
even though revealed, would be of no use to Joana, because it
didn't form her stem but her root, fastening her body to
everything that was no longer hers, imponderable and elusive.
Oh, there were motives for happiness, happiness without
laughter, serious, profound, fresh. Whenever she discovered
things about herself, the very moment she spoke, her thoughts
were running parallel to the words. One day, she had told
Otávio about Joana's childhood and the housemaid who
invented more games than anyone she had ever known. And
how she pretended to be dreaming.
— Are you sleeping?
— I'm fast asleep.
— Then wake up, it's morning... Did you dream?
At first she dreamed of sheep, of going to school, of cats
drinking milk. Little by little she dreamed of blue sheep, of
going to school in the middle of the woods, of cats drinking
milk from golden saucers. And her dreams became increasingly
dense and acquired colours that were difficult to dilute into
words.
— I dreamed that white balls were rising inside...
— What balls? Inside where?
— I don't know, only that they were coming...
After listening to her, Otávio had remarked:
— I'm beginning to think that they abandoned you much too
soon — your aunt's house... strangers... the boarding school...
Joana had thought: but there was the teacher. However, she
replied:
— No... What else could they have done with me? Surely
having had a childhood is everything one could wish for? No
one could take that away from me... — and at this moment
she was intrigued to discover that she was starting to listen to
herself.
— I wouldn't like to go back to being a child, not even for a
second, Otávio had continued, distracted, no doubt thinking
back to the days of his cousin Isabel and sweet Lídia. Not
even for a second.
— Nor me, Joana had hastened to reply, not even for a
second. I feel no nostalgia, do you understand? — And at that
moment she declared in a loud, deliberate tone of amazement
— It isn't nostalgia for I now enjoy my childhood more fully
than I did as a child...
Yes, there were many happy things mingled in her blood.
And Joana could also think and feel in various different ways
simultaneously. And so, while Otávio had been speaking, even
as she listened to him, she had been looking out of the
window at a little old woman in the sun, grubby, frail and
nimble — a branch quivering in the breeze. A dry branch
where there was so much femininity, Joana had thought, that
the poor woman might have had a son if life had not dried
up in her body. Later, even as Joana was replying to Otávio,
she remembered the lines her father had written specially to
amuse her during one of those what-is-there-for-me-to-do
outbursts:
Margarita befriended Violeta
the one was blind, the other mad,
the blind girl knew what the mad girl was saying
and ended up seeing what no one else saw...
 
Just like a wheel turning and turning, disturbing the air and
creating a breeze.
Even to suffer was good because while the basest suffering
unfolded, one also existed — like a river apart.
And one could also await the instant that came... that came...
and suddenly precipitated into the present only to dissolve...
and another that came... that came...
 
... The Bath...
The moment her aunt went to pay for her purchases, Joana
removed the book and slipped it furtively between the others
she was carrying under her arm. Her aunt turned pale.
Once in the street, the woman chose her words carefully:
— Joana.. .Joana, I saw you...
Joana gave her a quick glance. She remained silent.
— But you have nothing to say for yourself? — her aunt could
no longer restrain herself, her voice tearful. — Dear God, what
is to become of you?
— There's no need to fuss, Auntie.
— But you're still a child... Do you realize what you've done?
— I know...
— Do you know... do you know what it's called... ?
— I stole a book, isn't that what you're trying to say?
God help me! I don't know what I'm going to do, you even
have the nerve to own up!
— You forced me to own up.
— Do you think that you can... that you can just go around
stealing?
— Well... perhaps not.
— Why do you do it then... ?
— Because I want to.
— You what? — her aunt exploded.
— That's right, I stole because I wanted to. I only steal when I
feel like it. I'm not doing any harm.
— God help me! So, stealing does no harm, Joana.
— Only if you steal and are frightened. It doesn't make me
feel either happy or sad.
The woman looked at her in despair.
— Look child, you're growing up, it won't be long before
you're a young lady... Very soon now you will be wearing your
clothes longer... I beg of you: promise me that you won't do it
again, promise me, think of your poor father who is no longer
with us.
Joana looked at her inquisitively:
— But I'm telling you I can do what I like, that... — Her
explanations were futile — All right, I promise. For my father's
sake.
Some time later, passing the door of her aunt's room, Joana
could hear her, her voice low and interrupted by her breathing.
Joana put her ear to the door, at the spot where you could
even see the mark of her head.
— She's like a little demon.. .,A woman of my age and
experience, with a grown-up daughter of my own who is
already married, yet I simply cannot cope with Joana... I never
had any of this trouble with our Armanda, may God preserve
her for the sake of her dear husband. I can no longer be
responsible for the girl, I swear to you, Alberto... I can do
whatever I like, she had the nerve to say to me after I caught
her stealing... can you believe it... I was left speechless. I told
Father Felicio, begged him to advise me... It upset him too...
I've had enough! Even here in the house, she never says a
word, as if she didn't need anyone... And when she looks at
you, it's always straight in the eye, as if she were showing
contempt...
— True, her uncle said slowly, the strict discipline at boarding
school might help to tame her. Father Felicio is right. I'm
convinced that if my brother were still alive he wouldn't
hesitate in packing Joana off to boarding school, after catching
her stealing... Especially stealing, which is particularly sinful in
the eyes of God... Deep down this is what troubles me: her
father, irresponsible as he was, wouldn't even have hesitated in
sending Joana to a reformatory... I feel sorry for Joana, poor
child. You must agree that we would never have considered
sending Armanda away to boarding school, even if she had
robbed the entire bookshop.
— That's altogether different! Altogether different — her aunt
expostulated in triumph. Armanda, even were she to steal, is
one of us! And what about this girl... There's no need to feel
sorry for her, Alberto! It's me you should pity.. .Even when
Joana isn't in the house, I'm uneasy. It may sound foolish, but
I feel as if she were watching me all the time... and reading
my thoughts... Sometimes I'm laughing at something when I
suddenly break off as if I were paralysed. One of these days,
here in my own home where I brought up my own daughter,
I shall have to beg the forgiveness, God knows why, of this
wretched girl... She's a viper. She's a cold-blooded viper,
Alberto, she's capable of neither love nor gratitude. It's hopeless
trying to show her any affection, or doing anything for her. I
can't help feeling the girl is capable of murdering someone...
— That's quite enough! — her uncle exclaimed in alarm. If
Joana's father had been a better man, he would rise from his
grave this very moment!
— I'm sorry, I'm being stupid. She even makes me come out
with these foolish statements... She's a strange creature, Alberto,
who has neither friends nor God. May the Lord forgive me!
Joana's hands fidgeted, independent of her will. She observed
them with mild curiosity and forgot them almost immediately.
The ceiling was white, the ceiling was white. Even her
shoulders, which she had always thought of as being so remote
from herself, throbbed with life and began to tremble. Who
was she? The viper. Yes, yes, where could she escape to? She
didn't feel weak but on the contrary, gripped by a strange
passion, mingled with a certain feeling of happiness, sombre
and violent. I am suffering, she thought suddenly, taken by
surprise. I am suffering, a separate voice of awareness informed
her. And this other entity became gigantic all of a sudden and
replaced what she was suffering. Nothing ever happened if she
went on waiting for something to happen... Everything might
come to a halt and Joana would find herself striking in a void
like the hands of a clock. She remained empty for several
moments, watching herself attentively, probing the return of
sorrow. No, no, she did not want it! And as if to restrain
herself, ardent and impassioned, she slapped her own face.
She fled once more to her teacher, who still didn't know she
was a viper...
The teacher miraculously received her once more. And
miraculously he penetrated Joana's nebulous world where he
moved with gentleness and caution.
— It's not a question of matching up to other people's ideals.
The important thing is to be worthy in yourself. Do you
understand, Joana?
— Yes, yes...
He did most of the talking that afternoon.
— After all, animal existence is summed up in this seeking after
pleasure. Human life is more complex: it is summed up in the
pursuit of pleasure, in its fear, and, above all, in the intervening
moments of dissatisfaction. I'm putting it rather simply, but that
doesn't matter for now. Do you understand? Every desire is
seeking after pleasure. Every moment of remorse, compassion,
generosity, is its fear. All the despair, and searchings for other
paths betray dissatisfaction. That's it summed up, as it were.
Do you understand?
— Yes.
— When someone spurns pleasure, or starts living like a monk
in any sense, it's because they have an enormous capacity for
pleasure, a dangerous capacity — and so their fear is even
greater. Only those who keep their weapons under lock and
key are terrified of opening fire on everyone.
— Yes...
—     I said:  anyone who spurns... For there are plains, patches
of land that will never flower without manure.
She went on listening to him and it was as if her uncle and
aunt had never existed, as if the teacher and Joana herself
were isolated within the afternoon, within understanding.
— No, I really don't know how to advise you, the teacher was
saying. Tell me first of all: what is good and what is evil?
— I don't know...
— 'I don't know' is not a reply. Try to discover everything that
exists inside you.
— To live is good... she muttered. Evil is...
— Is what...?
— Evil is not to live...
— And to die? — he probed.
— No, no... she groaned.
— What then? Tell me.
— Not to live is evil, that's all. To die is something else. To die
is different from good and evil.
— Yes, he said, without understanding. Fine. Now tell me, for
example: who is the greatest man alive today, in your opinion?
She thought and thought, and gave no reply.
— What do you like most? — he rejoined.
Joana's face lit up, she got ready to speak and suddenly found
that she didn't know what to say.
— I don't know, I don't know, she said in despair.
— But how? Why then were you almost laughing with
pleasure? — the teacher asked in surprise.
— I don't know...
He looked at her severely:
— That you shouldn't be able to name the greatest man alive
today, even though you know lots of great men, is all very
well. But I refuse to accept that you don't know what you
yourself are feeling.
She looked at him with dismay:
— Believe me, the thing I like most of all in the world... is
what I feel deep inside me, opening out as it were... I could
almost tell you what it is, yet I cannot...
— Try to explain, he said, frowning.
— It's like something that's about to be... It's like...
— Like what? he leaned over, seriously demanding an
explanation.
— It's like wanting to take a deep breath, but there's also
fear... I don't know... I don't know, it almost hurts. It's
everything... It's everything.
— Everything?... — the teacher asked in astonishment. She
assented with a nod, visibly moved, mysterious, intense:
everything... He went on looking at her for a second, his small
face anguished and powerful:
— Fine.
He seemed satisfied but she couldn't understand why, since
she hadn't got round to saying anything about that. However,
if he was saying 'that's fine', she thought, fervent and
submissive, then it was true.
— Which person do you most admire? apart from me, apart
from me, the teacher added. Unless you help me, I shall never
get to know you, I shall never be able to guide you.
— I don't know, Joana said, wringing her hands under the
table.
— Why didn't you mention any one of the great men who are
alive today? You know at least ten of them. You're much too
honest, much too honest, he said with displeasure.
— I don't know...
— Well, it doesn't matter, he recovered his composure. Never
worry about not being able to express an opinion on a wide
range of topics. Never worry about being or not being
something. In any case, I suppose this is the only advice you
would accept. And get used to the idea: what you felt — about
what you like most of all in this world -might only have been
at the cost of not having any clear opinion about great men.
You will have to give up lots of things in order to receive
others. — Pause — Do you find this boring?
Joana thought for a second, her dark head tilted, her eyes
wide open.
— But when you have the highest thing, she asked slowly,
does that mean to say that you don't have all the things lower
down?
The teacher shook his head.
— No, he said, no. Not always. Sometimes one can possess
what is highest, in the end, one has the impression... — he
looked at her askance — one has the impression of dying in a
state of chastity. Perhaps this is because things are neither
higher nor lower. Simply different in quality, do you
understand?
Yes, she was beginning to understand those words and
everything they embraced. Yet notwithstanding, she had the
feeling that they possessed a false door, carefully concealed,
through which she would discover their real meaning.
— That the words mean more than you said — Joana finished
the explanation.
With a sudden movement, almost instinctively unawares, the
teacher stretched his hand across the table. Joana, trembling
with pleasure, put her hand in his, her face turning red.
— What's happened? — she said in a low voice. And she
loved that man as if she herself were a fragile blade of grass
being bent and lashed by the wind.
He did not answer, but his eyes were intense and betrayed
compassion. What? — suddenly she took fright:
— What's going to happen to me?
— I don't know — he replied after a brief silence — perhaps
you will find happiness one day, who knows, a happiness few
people will envy you. I'm not even sure that happiness is the
right word. Perhaps you won't find anyone else who feels as
you do, like...
The teacher's wife came into the room, tall, almost pretty with
that copper-coloured hair, cut short and worn straight. And,
above all, those long, serene thighs, moving blindly, but with
such confidence that it was intimidating. What was the teacher
about to say, mused Joana, before she came in? 'No one else
who feels as you do, like... like me?' Ah that woman. She
looked at her furtively, then lowered her eyes filled with rage.
There stood the teacher once more remote, his hand
withdrawn, tight-lipped, indifferent, as if Joana were simply a
'little friend', as his wife would say.
The latter had approached, had placed her slender hand, white
as wax, yet strangely attractive, on her husband's shoulder.
And Joana noted, so full of anguish that she could scarcely
swallow, the delightful contrast between these two human
beings. His hair still black, his huge body like that of an animal
greater than man.
— Would you like to have your dinner now? — his wife asked
him.
He played with the pencil between his fingers:
— Yes, I'm leaving earlier. The woman smiled at Joana and
slowly departed.
Still insecure, Joana thought that the appearance of that
creature made it clear that the teacher was a man while she
herself was not yet what might be called a 'young lady'. He
too must have noticed, dear God, he too must at least have
noticed how hateful that white woman could be, knowing as
she did how to destroy their previous conversation?
— Are you giving a class tonight? — she asked uncertainly just
for the sake of carrying on the conversation. And she blushed
as she uttered those words, they were so blank, so out of
place... Not in the tone of voice with which his wife had said,
beautiful and serene: Would you like an early dinner?
— Yes, I'm giving a class -he replied and fumbled through the
papers on the table.
Joana got up to go away and suddenly, even before she could
perceive her own gesture, she sat down again. She lowered her
head over the table and began to weep, covering her eyes. All
around there was silence and she could hear the slow, muffled
steps of someone inside the house. A long drawn-out minute
passed before she felt something pressing gently on her head.
It was a hand. His hand. She heard the hollow sound of her
heart, she had stopped breathing. All she could think of was
her own hair which now existed more than anything else, a
great, nervous, thick mop of hair being fondled by those
strange, animated fingers. His other hand raised her chin and
she allowed herself to be examined, submissive and trembling.
— What brought this on? — he asked, smiling. — Was it our
conversation?
She couldn't speak, she shook her head in denial.
— What was it then? — he insisted in a firm voice.
— It's just that I'm so ugly — she answered obediently, her
voice barely audible.
The teacher was startled. He opened his eyes wide, stared at
her in amazement.
— Now then — he tried to laugh it off — I had almost
forgotten that I was speaking to a little girl... Who said you
were ugly? — he laughed again. — Stand up.
She got up, broken-hearted, conscious that her knees were as
ashen and opaque as ever.
— You're still on the thin side, I agree, but things will improve,
don't you worry, he reassured her.
She stared at him from behind those final tears. How could
she explain to him? She didn't want to be consoled, he hadn't
understood... The teacher met her stare with a frown. What's
this? What's this? he asked himself with annoyance.
She held her breath
— I can wait.
The teacher, too, did not breathe for several seconds. He
asked, in a flat voice which suddenly sounded cold:
— Wait for what?
— Until I become pretty. Pretty like 'her'.
He himself was to blame. That was his first thought, as if he
had slapped his own face. He was to blame for having leaned
too close over Joana, for having sought, yes, sought — don't
escape, don't escape — thinking that it would go unpunished,
her promise of youth, that fragile and ardent stem. And before
he could restrain the thought — his hands clenched under the
table, it came without mercy: the selfishness and crude hunger
of old age was encroaching. Oh, how he loathed himself for
having thought of this. 'Her', his wife, was the prettier? The
'other one' was also pretty. And also the 'other one' of this
evening. But who possessed that shapeless body, those nervous
legs, breasts still unformed? — the miracle: still unformed, he
thought, feeling giddy, his vision blurred. Who was like clear,
fresh water? The hunger of old age was encroaching. He
cringed, terrified, furious, cowardly.
His wife came back into the room. She had changed for the
evening, her compact frame swathed in a blue, woollen dress.
Her husband stared at her at length, with a vague, somewhat
foolish expression on his face. She stared back at him, looking
thoughtful and enigmatic with the merest trace of a smile
lurking beneath the surface. Joana felt inhibited, became
insignificant and dull before that radiant complexion. The shame
of the scene that had taken place earlier came flooding back
and left her feeling absurd.
— I'm just going — she said.
The wife — or was she mistaken? — the wife looked her
straight in the eye, understanding, understanding! And then
raised her head, her bright, steady eyes expressing triumph,
perhaps even betraying a grain of sympathy:
— When shall we see you again, Joana? you should come and
have a chat with the teacher more often...
With the teacher, she said, toying with intimacy, and she was
white and smooth. Not miserable and not knowing about
anything, not abandoned, not with dirty knees like Joana, like
Joana! Joana got up and she knew that her skirt was too
short, that her blouse was sticking to her tiny, underdeveloped
breasts. She must escape, run to the beach, lie face down on
the sands, hide her face, listen to the sound of the sea.
She shook the woman's soft hand, shook his great paw, bigger
than a man's hand.
— Don't you want to take your book?
Joana turned round and caught him. She caught his
expression. Ah, discovery shone inside her, that look resembling
a handshake, that look that knew she longed for the beach.
But why so weak, so bereft of happiness? What had happened
in the end? Only a few hours ago they were calling her a
viper, the teacher fled, his wife waiting... What was happening?
Everything was retreating... And suddenly the setting detached
itself in her conscience with a screech, stood out in every
detail, burying the characters under a huge wave... Her very
feet were floating. The room where she had spent so many
afternoons glowed in the crescendo of an orchestra, making no
sound, taking revenge on her distraction. From one moment to
the next, Joana discovered the unsuspected power of that quiet
room. It was strange, silent, absent, as if they had never set
foot there, as if it were some reminiscence. Things had
preserved themselves until now and then drawn near to Joana,
surrounding her, shining in the semi-darkness of twilight.
Perplexed, she saw the naked statue standing on top of the
gleaming display-cabinet, the lines gently faded as in the finale
of a movement. The silence of those elegant, immobile chairs
transmitted itself to her brain, draining it slowly... She heard
quick footsteps out in the street, saw that tall, thoughtful
woman staring at her as well as that stockily-built man, with
bent shoulders. What did they expect of her? — she was
frightened. She felt the hard cover of the book between her
fingers, far, far away as if a great chasm were separating her
from her own hands. What then? Why did every human being
have something to say to her? Why, why? And what did they
want of her, constantly sucking her dry? Vertigo, rapid as a
whirlwind, took control of her head, causing her legs to wobble.
She stood before them for several minutes, silent, absorbing the
atmosphere of the house, but why were people not entirely
surprised at her inexplicable attitude towards them? Ah, one
could expect everything from her, the viper, even what
appeared strange, the viper, ah the pain, the happiness that
was paining her.
The couple stood out from the shadows, motionless before her
and only in the teacher's expression was there any hint of
surprise.
— I felt dizzy, she told them in a hushed voice and the
display-cabinet continued to shine like an enshrined saint.
She had barely spoken, her vision still clouded, when Joana
sensed an almost imperceptible movement coming from the
teacher's wife. They looked at each other and something mean,
avid, and humiliated in the wife made the stupefied Joana
begin to understand... It was her second attack of vertigo that
day! Yes, it was her second attack of vertigo that day! Like the
sounding of trumpets... She stared at them intently. I must get
out of this house, she called out in her excitement. The room
grew increasingly darker, and any moment now, she would
arouse fury in this man and woman! Like an outburst of rain,
like an outburst of rain...
Her feet sank into the sand and when they emerged once
more, they were leaden. It was already night, the sea tossed,
dark and restless, its waves lashed against the shore. The wind
had nestled in her hair and blew her short fringe in all
directions. Joana no longer felt giddy, a rough arm now
weighed on her bosom, a consoling weight. Something will
come soon, she thought in haste. This was the second attack
of vertigo on the same day! In the morning, when she jumped
out of bed, and now... There is more and more life in me, she
vaguely realized. She started to run. Suddenly she was freer,
more enraged at everything, she felt triumphant. But it wasn't
rage, it was love. A love so strong that it could only release its
passion in a violent outburst of wrath. Now I am a viper all
on my own. She remembered that she had left the teacher for
good and that after their conversation she would never be able
to return... She felt that he was far away, in that setting which
she now remembered with horror and estrangement. All on
her own...
Her uncle and aunt were already sitting at the table. In which
of them should she confide: I'm getting stronger every day, I'm
growing up, am I about to become a young woman? She
would confide neither in them nor anyone else. For she could
not bring herself to ask of anyone: Tell me about things? Only
to be told: I don't know either, just as the teacher had replied.
She could see the teacher reappear before her as in those final
moments, leaning towards her, terrified or ferocious, she
couldn't say, but backing away, that's it, backing away. The
reply, she felt, was not so important. What really mattered was
that her question had been accepted, that it could exist. Her
aunt would retort with surprise: what things? And should she
begin to understand, she would almost certainly say: like this,
and this, and this. With whom would Joana now speak of the
things that exist as naturally as one speaks of those other
things that simply are?
Things that exist, others that simply are... She was surprised at
this new and unexpected thought which would live from now
onwards like flowers on a grave. That would live, that would
live, other thoughts would be born and would live, and she
herself was more alive. Wild happiness cut into her heart, lit up
her body. She pressed the glass between her fingers, drank
water with her eyes closed as if she were sipping wine, bloody
and glorious wine, the blood of God. No, she would not tell
anyone that everything was slowly changing... That she had put
away her smile like someone who finally switches off the light
and settles down to sleep. No human beings could now be
permitted to enter her inner world and merge therein. Her
relations with other people became increasingly different from
the relations she maintained with herself. The sweetness of
childhood disappeared without trace, no more water flowed
from some inner fountain and what she offered the footsteps
of passing strangers was parched, colourless sand. But she was
walking onwards, ever onwards, as one walks along the shore,
the wind caressing her face, blowing her hair back.
How was she to tell them: this is the second attack of vertigo
today, even though she desperately wanted to confide in
someone? For no one else in her life, no one else would
probably ever say to her like the teacher: one lives and one
dies. Everyone was forgetting that all they wanted to do was to
amuse themselves. She looked at them. Her aunt amused
herself with the house, the cook, her husband, with her
married daughter and visitors. Her uncle amused himself with
his job, his farm, a game of chess, the newspapers. Joana
tried to analyse them, thinking that in this way she could
destroy them. Yes, they were fond of each other in a distant,
familiar way. From time to time, absorbed in their games, they
would glance at each other anxiously, as if to reassure
themselves that they still existed. Only to resume that lukewarm
distance between them which lessened when one of them went
down with flu or had a birthday. They certainly slept in the
same bed, Joana thought without satisfaction or malice.
Her aunt held out the plate of bread in silence. Her uncle
didn't so much as raise his eyes from his plate.
Eating was a matter of great concern in that household, Joana
continued. During meals, his arms resting firmly on the table,
the man nourished himself as he gasped for breath because he
suffered from heart trouble. As he chewed, with some crumb
or morsel of food stuck to his mouth, he stared with a glazed
expression at some object or other, his attention focused on
the inner sensations produced by the food. Her aunt crossed
her ankles under her chair. With puckered eyebrows, she ate
with a curiosity which renewed itself with every mouthful, her
face rejuvenated and mobile. But why were they not sitting
back comfortably in their chairs today? Why were they taking
so much care not to make a noise with their cutlery, as if
someone were dead or asleep? It's because of me, Joana
decided.
Around the dark table, under the light weakened by the lamp's
soiled fringes, silence, too, had settled that night. Now and
then, Joana paused to listen to the sound of those two mouths
chewing and to the quick, restless tick-tock of the clock. Then
the woman lifted her eyes and rooted to the spot, with her
fork in one hand, she waited, apprehensive and defeated.
Joana averted her gaze. Triumphant, she lowered her head
with a profound happiness that was inexplicably mingled with a
sharp tightening in her throat, making it impossible to sob.
— Has Armanda not come? — Joana's voice accelerated the
tick-tock of the clock, provoked a sudden rapid movement at
the table.
Her uncle and aunt eyed each other furtively. Joana sighed
aloud: was she afraid of her then?
— Armanda's husband isn't on duty today, so she isn't coming
to dinner, her aunt finally replied. And suddenly, as if satisfied,
she began eating. Her uncle chewed more quickly. Silence
returned without dissolving the distant murmur of the sea. So,
they didn't have the courage.
— When am I being sent to boarding-school? — Joana asked.
The soup tureen slipped from her aunt's hands, the dark,
cynical broth spread rapidly over the table. Her uncle rested
his knife and fork on his plate, anguish written all over his
face.
— How do you know that... he stammered in confusion... She
had been listening at the door...
The drenched tablecloth gave off gentle fumes like the dying
embers of a fire. Immobile and mesmerised as if she were
confronting something beyond remedy, the woman stared at
the spilled soup which was rapidly getting cold.
 
 
The water, blind and deaf, but happily not mute, sparkling and
bubbling as if splashed on the bright enamel of the bathtub.
The bathroom was filled with warm vapours, the mirrors
covered in steam, the naked body of a young girl reflected on
the damp mosaic walls.
The girl laughs softly, rejoicing in her own body. Her smooth,
slender legs, her tiny breasts emerge from the water. She
scarcely knows herself, still not fully grown, still almost a child.
She stretches out one leg, looks at her foot from a distance,
moves it tenderly, slowly, like a fragile wing. She lifts her arms
above her head, stretches them out towards the ceiling lost in
the shadows, her eyes closed, without any feeling, only
movement. Her body stretches and spreads out, the moisture
on her skin glistening in the semi-darkness — her body tracing
a tense, quivering line. When she drops her arms once more,
she becomes compact, white and secure. She chuckles to
herself, moves her long neck from one side to another, tilts
her head backwards -the grass is always fresh, someone is
about to kiss her, soft, tiny rabbits snuggle up against each
other with their eyes shut. — She starts laughing again, gentle
murmurings like those of water. She strokes her waist, her
hips, her life.
She sinks into the bathtub as if it were the sea. A tepid world
closes over her silently, quietly. Small bubbles slip away gently
and vanish once they touch the enamel. The young girl feels
the water weighing on her body, she pauses for a moment as
if someone had tapped her lightly on the shoulder. Paying
attention to what she is feeling, the invading tide. What has
happened? She becomes a serious creature, with wide, deep
eyes. She can scarcely breathe. What has happened? The open,
silent eyes of things went on shining amidst the vapours. Over
the same body that has divined happiness there is water —
water. No, no... Why? Creatures born into the world like water.
She becomes restless, tries to escape. Everything — she says
slowly as if handing over something, as if probing herself
without understanding. Everything. And that word is peace,
solemn and enigmatic, like some ritual. The water covers her
body. But what has happened? She murmurs in a low voice,
she utters syllables that are lukewarm and jumbled.
The bathroom is hazy, almbst extinct. The objects and walls
have caved in, melt and dissolve into fumes. The water feels a
little cooler on her skin and she trembles with fear and
discomfort.
When she emerges from the bathtub she is a stranger who
doesn't know what she should feel. Around her there is
nothing and she knows nothing. She is weak and sad, she
moves slowly, unhurried, for some considerable time. The cold
runs down her back with icy feet but she is in no mood to
play, she huddles up, wounded and unhappy. She dries herself
without love, humiliated and miserable, wraps herself in the
dressing-gown as in a warm embrace. Shut up in herself,
unwilling to look, ah, unwilling to look, she slips through the
passageway — that long throat, crimson, dark, and
discreet-sinking down into the belly, into everything. Everything,
everything, she repeats mysteriously. She closes the window in
the room — reluctant to see, hear or feel anything. In the
silent bed, floating in the darkness, she curls up as if she were
in the last womb and forgets. Everything is vague, uncertain
and silent.
Lined up behind her were the dormitory beds from the
boarding-school. And in front, the window opened onto the
night.
I've discovered a miracle in the rain — Joana thought — a
miracle splintered into dense, solemn, glittering stars, like a
suspended warning: like a lighthouse. What are they trying to
tell me? In those stars I can foretell the secret, their brilliance
is the impassive mystery I can hear flowing inside me, weeping
at length in tones of romantic despair. Dear God, at least bring
me into contact with them, satisfy my longing to kiss them. To
feel their light on my lips, to feel it glow inside my body,
leaving it shining and transparent, fresh and moist like the
minutes that come before dawn. Why do these strange longings
possess me? Raindrops and stars, this dense and chilling fusion
has roused me, opened the gates of my green and sombre
forest, of this forest smelling of an abyss where water flows.
And harnessed it to night. Here, beside the window, the
atmosphere is more tranquil. Stars, stars, zero. The word
cracks between my teeth into fragile splinters. Because no rain
falls inside me, I wish to be a star. Purify me a little and I
shall acquire the dimensions of those beings who take refuge
behind the rain.
At this moment, inspiration sends pain throughout my body.
One more second, and it will need to be something greater
than inspiration. Instead of this suffocating happiness, as if
there were too much air, I shall experience the clear
impossibility of having more than inspiration, of surpassing it, of
possessing the thing itself — and really be a star. Look where
madness, madness leads one. Nevertheless, it is the truth. What
does it matter that to all appearances I am still in the
dormitory at this moment, the other girls fast asleep in their
beds, their bodies quite still. What does it matter what it really
is? Truly I am on my knees, naked as an animal, beside the
bed, my soul despairing as only the body of a virgin can
despair. The bed gradually disappears, the walls of the room
recede, collapse in ruins. And I am in the world, as free and
lithe as a colt on the plain. I rise as gentle as a puff of air, I
raise my sleepy head like that of a flower, my feet agile, and
cross the fields, further than the earth, the world, time, God. I
sink only to emerge, as if from clouds, from lands still
inconceivable, ah, still inconceivable. From lands, still beyond my
powers of imagination, but which will appear one day. I roam,
I wander, I go on and on... Always without stopping, distracting
my weary desire to reach some final resting-place. Where did I
once see a moon high in the sky, white and silent? Livid
clothing fluttering in the breeze. The mast without a flag, erect
and mute, rooted in space... Everything awaiting midnight — I
am deceiving myself, I must return. I feel no madness in my
desire to bite into stars, but the earth still exists. And the first
truth resides in the earth and in the body. If the brilliance of
the stars causes internal pain, if this remote communication is
possible, it's because something almost resembling a star
glimmers inside me. Here I am, returned to the body. To
return to my body. When I suddenly see myself in the depths
of the mirror, I take fright. I can scarcely believe that I have
limits, that I am outlined and defined. I feel myself to be
dispersed in the atmosphere, thinking inside other creatures,
living inside things beyond myself. When I suddenly see myself
in the mirror, I am not startled because I find myself ugly or
beautiful. I discover, in fact, that I possess another quality.
When I haven't looked at myself for some time, I almost forget
that I am human, I tend to forget my past, and I find myself
with the same deliverance from purpose and conscience as
something that is barely alive. I am also surprised to find as I
gaze into the pale mirror with open eyes that there is so much
in me beyond what is known, so much that remains ever
silent. Why silent? Do these curves beneath my blouse exist
with impunity? Why are they silent? My mouth, still somewhat
childlike, so certain of its destiny, remains true to itself, despite
my total distraction. Sometimes, upon making this discovery,
there comes this love for myself, constant glances in the mirror,
a knowing smile for those who stare at me. A period of
interrogation addressed to my body, a time of greed, sleep,
long walks in the open air. Until some phrase or glance — like
that in the mirror — unexpectedly reminds me of other secrets,
those which remove all limits. Enthralled, I plunge my body to
the bottom of the well, I penetrate all its sources and walking
in my sleep I follow another path. -To analyse moment by
moment, to perceive the nucleus of each thing made from time
or space. To possess each moment, to link them to my
awareness, like tiny filaments, barely perceptible yet strong. Can
this be life? Even so, it might elude me. Another way of
capturing it would be to live. But the dream is more complete
than the reality; the latter plunges me into unconsciousness.
What matters in the end: to be alive or to know that one is
alive? — The purest of words, crystal drops. I feel their moist
and gleaming form struggling inside me. But where can I find
what I must express? Inspire me, I have almost everything: I
possess the outline awaiting the essence; is that it? — What is
someone to do who doesn't know what to do with himself? To
utilize himself as body and soul to the advantage of his body
and soul? Or to transform his strength into an alien strength?
Or to wait for the solution to come from himself as a
consequence? I can express nothing, not even within form. All
I possess lies much deeper inside me. One day, after finally
speaking, shall I still have something on which to live? Or will
everything that I might say be beneath and beyond life?
— I try to distance myself from everything that is a form of
life. I try to isolate myself in order to find life in itself.
Nevertheless, I have relied too much on the game that distracts
and consoles and when I distance myself from it, I suddenly
find myself defenceless. The moment I close the door behind
me, I instantly detach myself from things. All that has been
distances itself from me, quietly sinking into my remote waters.
I can hear it drop. Happy and tranquil, I wait for myself, I
wait for myself to rise and to emerge as I really am before my
own eyes. Instead of securing myself with my flight, I see
myself abandoned, solitary, thrown into a cell without
dimensions, where light and shadows are silent phantoms.
Within my inner self I find the silence I am seeking. But it
leaves me so bereft of any memory of any human being and
of me myself, that I transform this impression into the certainty
of physical solitude. Were I to cry out — I can no longer see
things clearly — my voice would receive the same indifferent
echo from the walls of the earth. So without experiencing
things, should I not find life? But, even so, in the white and
limited solitude where I fall, I am still trapped amidst
impenetrable mountains. Trapped, trapped. Where is my
imagination? I walk over invisible tracks. Prison, freedom. These
are the words that occur to me. But I sense that they are not
the only true and irreplaceable ones. Freedom means little.
What I desire still has no name. — For I am a toy they wind
up and once this has been done it will not find its own, much
deeper life. To search tranquilly, to concede that perhaps I may
only find it were I to look for it in secondary sources.
Otherwise I shall die of thirst. Perhaps I have not been made
for the pure, expansive waters, but for those which are small
and readily accessible. And perhaps my craving for another
source, which gives me the expression of someone in search of
food, perhaps this craving is a whim-and nothing more. Yet
surely those rare moments of self-confidence, of blind existence,
of happiness as intense and serene as an organ playing —
surely those moments prove that I am capable of fulfilling my
quest and that this longing which consumes my whole being is
not merely some whim? Moreover, that whim is the truth! I
cry out to myself. Such moments are rare. Only yesterday, I
suddenly thought in class, almost out of the blue, apropos of
nothing: movement explains form. The clear notion of the
perfect, the sudden freedom I felt... That day, on my uncle's
farm, when I fell into the river. Before I was impenetrable and
opaque. But when I clambered out, it as as if I had been
born from water. I got out soaking wet, my clothes clinging to
my skin, my hair shining wet and straggling. Something stirred
inside me and it was almost certainly only my body. But a
sweet miracle can make everything transparent and this was
certainly my soul as well. At that moment I was truly inside
my inner self and there was silence. Only I realized that my
silence was part of the silence of the countryside. And I did
not feel abandoned. The horse, from which I'd fallen, was
waiting for me beside the river. I remounted and sped along
the slopes where refreshing shadows were gathering. I pulled
up the reins, stroked the animal's fevered and throbbing neck.
I rode on at a slow pace, listening to the happiness inside me,
as high and limpid as a summer sky. I stroked my arms
where there were still trickles of water. I could feel the live
animal close to me, an extension of my body. We both
breathed, throbbing and youthful. A somewhat sombre colour
had settled on the plains, warmed by the last rays of sunlight
and the gentle breeze slowly died away. I must never forget, I
thought, that I have been happy, that I am happy, happier
than anyone could hope to be. But I forgot, I was always
forgetting.
I sat waiting in the Cathedral, distracted and vague. I inhaled
the overpowering odour, purple and cold, that emanated from
the holy statues. And suddenly before I knew what was
happening, like some cataclysm, the invisible organ burst out
into rich tremulous strains of the utmost purity. Without any
melody, almost without any music, almost without any
vibrations. The lengthy walls and high vaults of the church
received and returned those strains, sonorous, naked, and
intense. They penetrated my body, criss-crossed inside me, filled
my nerves with tremors, my brain with sounds. I thought no
thoughts, only music. Impassively, under the weight of that
canticle, I slid from the bench and knelt down without praying,
annihilated. The organ fell silent with the same suddenness with
which it had started up, like an inspiration. I went on
breathing quietly, my body still vibrating to the final strains that
hovered in midair in a warm, translucent buzzing. And the
moment was so perfect that I felt neither fear nor gratitude
and did not invoke God. I want to die now, something called
out inside me, a cry of freedom rather than suffering. Any
moment following upon that one would be less exalted and
empty. I wanted to rise and only death, as an end, could
grant me the summit without the descent. People were getting
up around me, were stirring. I stood up and made for the
exit, weak and pale.
 
The Woman with the Voice and Joana
Joana didn't pay all that much attention to her until she heard
her voice. That low, arched tone, without any vibrations, roused
her. She stared at the woman inquisitively. She must have
experienced something that was still unknown to Joana. She
could not grasp that intonation, so remote from life, so remote
from the days...
Joana recalled how on one occasion, a few months after being
married, she had turned to her husband to ask him something.
They were in the street. And before actually finishing the
sentence, to Otávio's surprise, she had paused — looking
worried and distracted. Ah — I had discovered -then she
affected one of those voices she had heard so often before
getting married, always vaguely perplexed. The voice of a young
woman at the side of her man. Like her own voice speaking
at that moment to Otávio: sharp, empty, raised to a high pitch,
with clear, even notes. Something incomplete, ecstatic, somewhat
blase. Straining to call out... Bright days, limpid and dry, a
voice and days that were sexless, choirboys singing at an
open-air service. And something lost, heading for mild
despair...The timbre of a newly-wed woman had a history, a
fragile history that went unnoticed by the woman with the
voice, but not by this one.
Ever since that day Joana heard the voices, whether she
understood them or not. Probably at the end of her life, with
every timbre she heard, a tide of personal reminiscences would
come flooding back Joana would say: how many voices I've
possessed...
She leaned towards the woman. She had approached her when
looking for a house to live in and was glad that she had gone
without her husband because, on her own, she could observe
her with greater freedom. And there, yes, there she found
something she had not anticipated, a pause. But the other
woman didn't as much as look at her. Thinking as Otávio
might, Joana surmised that he would think of the woman as
being simply coarse, with that big nose, pale and calm. The
woman explained the conveniences and inconveniences of the
house she was offering to rent while casting her eyes over the
floor, the window, the view, without haste, without interest. She
was clean and tidy and had dark hair. Her body, ample and
sturdy. And her voice, her voice was of the earth. Not colliding
with any object, soft and distant as if it had travelled lengthy
paths beneath the soil before reaching her throat.
— Married? -Joana asked, leaning over her.
— Widowed, with one son. — And she went on distilling her
song over all the lodgers in the district.
— No, I don't think I'm interested in the house, it's much too
big for two, Joana said briskly, even a little harshly. But added
— softening her tone, concealing her eagerness -would you
mind if I called from time to time to have a chat?
The other woman showed no surprise. She ran one hand over
her waist, grown thick with pregnancy and the slowness of her
movements:
— That might be difficult.. .Tomorrow, I'm leaving to visit my
son. He's married. I'm going away...
She smiled without happiness, without emotion. Simply: I'm
going away... What did interest that woman? -Joana asked
herself. Could she have a lover...
— Do you live alone? — she asked her.
— My younger sister has gone off to be a nun. I live with my
other sister.
— Don't you find life rather sad without a man around the
house? -Joana went on.
— Do you think so? — the woman retorted.
— I'm asking you, if you don't find it sad, not me. I'm
married, Joana added, trying to bring a note of intimacy into
the conversation.
— Ah, no, I don't find it sad, not in the least — And she gave
her a wan smile. — Well, since the house obviously isn't what
you're looking for, I must ask you to excuse me. I have to
wash a few clothes before having a little rest by the window.
Joana went on her way feeling nettled. The woman was clearly
moronic... But that voice? It haunted her throughout the entire
afternoon. She tried to recall the woman's smile, her ample,
lethargic body. The woman had no history, Joana slowly
realized. For if things happened to her, they were not part of
her and did not merge with her true existence. The essential
thing — including past, present and future — is that she was
alive. That is the nucleus of the narrative. Sometimes this
nucleus seemed blurred, as if seen with one's eyes shut, almost
non-existent. But it only needed a brief pause, a little silence,
for it to become enormous and to loom up with open eyes, a
soft and constant murmur like that of water trickling among
pebbles. Why elaborate on this description? It is certain that
things happened to her which came from outside. She lost her
illusions, suffered an attack of pneumonia. Things happened to
her. But they only served to consolidate or weaken the
murmur of her centre. Why narrate facts and details if no one
dominated her in the end? And if she were merely the life that
flowed constantly inside her body?
Her probings never became agitated in their search for an
answer—Joana continued to make discoveries. Her questions
were still-born, they accumulated without desire or hope. She
attempted no movement outside herself.
Many years of her existence were spent at the window,
watching the things that passed and those that stood still. But
in fact she didn't so much see the life inside her as hear it.
Its sound had fascinated her — like the breathing of a
new-born infant — its gentle glow — like that of a new-born
plant. She had not yet grown weary of existing and she was
so self-sufficient that sometimes, out of sheer happiness, she felt
sadness cover her like the shadow of a mantle, leaving her as
fresh and silent as nightfall. She expected nothing. She was in
herself, her own end.
Once she divided herself, became restless, she began to go out
in search of herself. She went to places where men and
women were gathered. They said to themselves: fortunately, she
has woken up, life is short, one must make the most of it.
Previously, she was spiritless, now she's a real person. No one
realized that she was being unhappy to the point of needing to
go in search of life. That was when she chose a man, loved
him and love came to thicken her blood and mystery. She
gave birth to a son, her husband died after impregnating her.
She carried on and thrived very well. She gathered together all
her belongings and no longer went looking for people. She
rediscovered her window where she settled, enjoying her own
company. And now, more than ever, there was no thing or
creature more happy and fulfilled to be found. Despite all those
people who looked at her condescendingly, believing her to be
weak. For her spirit was so strong that she had never
neglected to have an excellent lunch or dinner without,
however, any excessive indulgence. Nothing they could say
bothered her or whatever happened to her, and everything slid
over her and vanished into waters other than those inside her.
One day, after having patiently experienced many such days,
she saw herself different from herself. She felt weary. She
paced to and fro. She herself didn't know what she wanted.
She began to hum quietly without opening her mouth. Then
she tired of this and began to think about things. But she
didn't quite succeed. Inside her something was trying to call a
halt. She waited but nothing came from her to her. She slowly
grew sad from a lack of sadness, and was therefore twice as
sad. She went on walking for several days and her footsteps
sounded like withered leaves falling to the ground. She herself
was lined inside with greyness, and she could see nothing
within herself other than a reflection of her ancient rhythm,
now slow and leaden. Then she knew that she was drained
and for the first time she suffered because she really had
become divided in two, one part facing the other, watching it,
desiring things that it could no longer give. In fact, she had
always been two, the one who superficially knew that she was,
and the one that truly existed in depth. Until now both parts
functioned together and merged. Now the one that knew that
she was, functioned on its own, which meant that that woman
was being unhappy and intelligent. She made one last effort to
try and invent something, some thought that might distract her.
In vain. She only knew how to live.
Until the absence of herself finally made her fall into the night,
and pacified, darkened, and refreshed, she began to die. She
then embraced sweet death, as if she were a ghost. Nothing
more is known because she died. One can merely surmise that
in the end she, too, was being happy as only a thing or
creature can be. For she had been born for the essential, to
live or die. And for her, the intermediary was suffering. Her
existence was so complete and so closely bound to truth that
she probably thought at the moment of surrendering and
reaching her end, had she been in the habit of thinking: I
never was. Nor is it known what became of her. Such a
beautiful life must surely have been followed by a beautiful
death. Today she is certainly grains of earth. She never ceases
to gaze up at the sky. Sometimes when it rains, her grains
remain full and rotund. Then she dries up in summer and the
slightest breeze disperses her. She is now eternal.
After a moment's hesitation, Joana saw that she had envied
her, that half-dead creature who was smiling and had spoken
to her in an unfamiliar tone of voice. Above all, she went on
thinking, she understands life because she is not sufficiently
intelligent not to understand it. But what was the use of trying
to reason things out... Were she to reach the point of
understanding her, without going mad in the process, she
wouldn't be able to preserve knowledge as knowledge but
would transform it into an attitude, into an attitude of life, the
only way of possessing knowledge and of fully expressing it.
And that attitude would not be very different from the one in
which the woman with the voice reposed. The paths of action
were so impoverished. She made a quick, impatient movement
with her head. She grabbed a pencil, and on a piece of paper
scribbled decisively in bold letters: 'The personality that ignores
itself achieves greater fulfilment.' True or false? But in a sense
she had taken her revenge by casting her cold intelligent
thought over that woman swollen with life.
 
Otávio
'De Profundis'. Joana waited for the idea to become clearer, for
that tenuous and luminous bubble, the germ of a thought, to
rise from the mists. 'De Profundis'. She felt it vacillate, almost
lose its balance and sink forever into unknown waters. Or at
certain moments, push back the clouds and tremulously grow,
emerging almost completely... Then silence.
She closed her eyes, gradually she began to rest. When she
opened them again, she received a tiny shock. And during the
intense, prolonged moments that followed, she recognized that
stretch of life as the combination of what she had lived and
what remained to be lived, fused together and eternal. Strange,
strange. The amber light on the stroke of nine, that impression
of an interval, a distant piano being played with emphasis on
the sharp notes, her heart beating furiously as it met the
morning heat, and behind everything, the throbbing silence,
ferocious and menacing, dense and impalpable. Everything
began to fade. The piano interrupted its insistence on those
final notes and after a momentary pause gently resumed with
some middle notes, producing a vivid straightforward melody.
And soon she wouldn't be able to tell whether her impression
of the morning had been real or simply an idea. She lingered,
attentively trying to place it... A sudden weariness confused her
for a moment. Her nerves forgotten, her face relaxed, she felt
a gentle gust of tenderness for herself, almost of gratitude, even
though she couldn't explain why. For a second, it struck her
that she had lived and that her life was coming to an end.
And immediately afterwards, that everything had been blank so
far, like an empty space, that she could hear, remote and
muffled, the clamour of life approaching, dense, torrential and
violent, its mighty waves rending the sky, coming closer and
closer ... to submerge her, to drown her, suffocating her...
She went up to the window, stretched her hands outside and
waited in vain for a little wind to come and caress them. And
there she remained, oblivious of everything, for some
considerable time. She blocked her ears by contracting the
muscles of her face, her closed eyes barely allowing the light to
penetrate, her head leaning forward. Little by little, she
managed to isolate herself completely. This semi-conscious state,
where she had the impression of plunging deeply into grey,
lukewarm air... She stood in front of the mirror and muttered
to herself, her eyes burning with hatred:
— And now what?
She couldn't fail to notice her own face, small and flushed. This
distracted her momentarily, helping her to forget her anger.
Some little thing always occurred just in time to divert her
from the main torrent. She was so vulnerable. Did she hate
herself for this? No, she would hate herself more if she were
already an immutable tree-trunk until death, capable only of
yielding fruits but not of growing within herself. She craved for
even more: to be constantly reborn, to cut away everything
she had learned, that she had seen, and to make a fresh start
in some new terrain where even the most trifling act might
have some meaning, where she might breathe air as if for the
very first time. She had the feeling that dense life was flowing
slowly inside her, bubbling like a sheet of hot lava. Perhaps if
she were to fall in love... And if the thought seemed remote,
the piercing blast of a trumpet might suddenly sever that
mantle of night and leave the fields empty, green, and vast...
And then excitable, white horses rebelliously craning and
rearing, almost flying, might cross rivers, mountains, valleys...
Thinking about them, she felt the fresh air circulate inside her
as if it were escaping from some hidden grotto, damp and
fresh in the middle of the desert.
But she soon returned to her senses, in vertical descent. She
examined her arms and legs. There she was. There she was.
But she must first distract herself, she thought, with firmness
and irony. With urgency. For might she not die? She laughed
aloud and took a quick glance at herself in the mirror to
observe the effect of that laughter on her face. No, no it didn't
make it brighter. She looked like a wild cat, her eyes burning
above her red cheeks, covered in dark freckles, her brown hair
dishevelled over her eyebrows. She perceived in herself a
sombre and triumphant purple. What was she doing that she
should glow like this? Weariness ... Yes, despite everything,
there was fire beneath her weariness, there was fire even when
it represented death. Perhaps this was the taste of living.
Once more she was overcome by sheer, inexplicable weariness.
Ah, perhaps I should go, perhaps... She closed her eyes for a
moment, permitting herself the birth of a gesture or of a
phrase without logic. She always did this, confident that deep
down, beneath the lava, there might be a desire already
directed to some goal. Sometimes, when she closed the doors
of consciousness through a special mechanism not unlike that
of lapsing into sleep, and allowed herself to act or speak, she
was surprised to receive — for she only perceived the gesture
at the moment of its execution — a slap on her face from her
own hand. Sometimes she heard strange gibberish coming from
her lips. Even without understanding those words, they brought
a sense of relief, and greater freedom.
And from the core of herself, after a moment of silence and
abandon, there surged, at first pale and hesitant, then
increasingly compelling and painful: I summon you from the
depths... I summon you from the depths... I summon you from
the depths... She remained still for a few more minutes, her
expression vacant, listless and weary, as if she had given birth
to a child. Little by little, she started to be reborn, she opened
her eyes slowly and returned to the light of day. Fragile,
breathing quietly, happy as a convalescent enjoying that first
moment of fresh air.
Then she began to think that she had actually prayed. Not
her. Something greater than her and of which she was
unaware had prayed. But she had no desire to pray because
she knew that prayer would be the remedy. But a remedy like
morphine that numbs any kind of pain. Like the morphine one
needs in ever increasing doses in order to feel any effect. No,
no she was not so worn out that she should be cowardly
enough to want to pray instead of discovering pain, of suffering
and possessing it entirely in order to experience all pain's
mysteries. And even if she were to pray... She would end up
in a convent because all the morphine in the world would not
be enough to satisfy her craving. And this would be the final
degradation: addiction. Yet unless she were to seek an external
god by some natural cause, she would finish up deifying herself
in order to explore her own sorrow, by loving her past, by
seeking refuge and warmth in her own thoughts, born initially
with a desire for a work of art and later serving as familiar
nourishment during periods of sterility. She was in danger of
establishing and regimenting herself inside suffering, which would
also be an addiction and form of sedation.
What was to be done then? What was to be done to interrupt
that path, to grant herself some respite between her and
herself in order to be able to re-encounter herself without
danger, renewed and pure?
What was to be done?
The piano was deliberately attacked with measured uniform
scales. Exercises, she thought. Exercises... Yes, she discovered
feeling amused... Why not? Why not try to fall in love? Why
not try to live?
 
 
Pure music unfolding in some uninhabited land, Otávio mused.
Moments still without adjectives. Unconscious like the primitive
life that pulsates in the blind, impassive trees, in the tiny insects
that are born, fly, perish and are reborn unobserved. Meantime
the music gyrates and develops, they live the dawn, the
powerful day, the night, with one constant note in the
symphony, that of transformation. This is music which is not
sustained by things, by space or time, the same colour as life
and death. The life and death in ideas, isolated from pleasure
and pain. So remote from any human qualities that they might
be confused with silence. Silence. Silence, because this music
would be the necessary one, the only possible one, the vibrant
projection of matter. And in the same way as one doesn't
understand matter or perceive it until the senses come up
against it, no one hears its melody.
And then? — he thought. To close my eyes and hear my own
music which trickles slow and dark like a muddy river.
Cowardice is lukewarm and I'm resigned to it, laying down all
the heroic weapons which twenty-seven years of thought have
granted me. What am I today, at this moment? A trampled,
silent leaf, fallen to the ground. No movement of air to rustle
it. Scarcely breathing so as not to awaken. But why not, above
all, why not use the appropriate words and entangle and
envelop myself in images? Why call myself a withered leaf
when I am merely a man with folded arms?
Once more, amidst futile reasoning, he was overcome by
weariness, a feeling of despondency. To pray, to pray. To kneel
before God and beg. For what? Absolution. Such a long word,
so full of meaning. He was not guilty — or was he? Guilty of
what? He knew that he was, however, he clung to the thought
— he was not guilty, but how he would love to receive
absolution. On his forehead the broad, plump finger of God,
blessing him like a good father, a father made from earth and
universe, embracing everything, without omitting to possess even
a particle that might later say to him: yes, but I have not
forgiven you! Then there would be an end to the silent
accusation which all things harboured against him.
What did he think after all? For how long had he been stuck
there playing this game with himself? He made some gesture
or other.
Cousin Isabel came into the room. 'Blessed, blessed, blessed',
her hasty, short-sighted glance was saying, anxious to withdraw.
She only abandoned that air of being a stranger when she sat
down at the piano. Otávio flinched as he used to when he was
a little boy. She then smiled, became human, lost that piercing
look. She became more amiable and relaxed in her manner.
Seated at the piano, her cracked lips covered in powder, she
played Chopin, Chopin, especially the waltzes.
My fingers have become stiff, she said, proud of being able to
play from memory. As she spoke, she threw her head back,
suddenly appearing coquettish as if she were a dancer in a
cabaret. Otávio blushed. Whore, he thought, and erased the
word at once with a painful movement. But how dare she? He
remembered her face leaning over him attentively, concerned
about his stomach-ache. That's why I detest her, he thought
illogically. And it was always too late: the thought anticipated
him. Whore — as if he were thrashing himself with a whip. Yet
even though he repented, he would sin again. How often as a
child, just before falling asleep, he would suddenly become
aware that Aunt Isabel was in the bed, unable to sleep,
perhaps sitting up, her grey hair tied into a pigtail, her flannel
nightdress buttoned up to the neck like that of a virgin.
Remorse like acid pervaded his body. But he detested her
more and more because he could not love her.
She was no longer capable of achieving as before that smooth
transition from one note to another, that sensation of trance.
One sound stuck to the other, harsh, syncopated, and the
waltzes exploded, feeble, spasmodic and flawed. From time to
time, the slow, hollow chimes of the old clock rang out, dividing
the music into asymmetrical bars. Otávio remained there waiting
for the next stroke, his heart in his mouth. As if those chimes
were precipitating all things in a silent dance of sweet insanity.
Those implacable chimes interrupting the music with the same
cold and smiling tone, threw him back on himself as if into a
void without any support. He watched his aunt's firm
shoulders, her hands — two swarthy creatures leaping over the
piano's yellow keys. She turned round and said to him,
conceding the phrase out of sheer euphoria, graciously, like
someone throwing flowers:
— What's ailing you? I'm now going to play you something
more cheerful...
She broke into one of those ballroom waltzes, spontaneous and
jumpy, which he couldn't recall having heard before but which
were mysteriously connected with fragmented memories of the
past.
— Not that one, Auntie, not that one...
It was too absurd by far. He was afraid. To beg forgiveness
because he didn't feel ecstatic about her playing, to beg
forgiveness because he had found her unbearable even as a
little boy, with that smell of musty clothes, of jewellery ingrained
with dust, as he watched her prepare him 'a nice little cup of
tea to settle his tummy', when she promised to play him
something pretty if he finished his homework. He could see her
once more leaving the house. Her grey skin floured in talcum
powder, her low, curved neckline exposing her neck where the
veins stood out dramatically. Her low-heeled pumps like those
worn by teenage girls, her umbrella brandished with disarming
vigour, as if it were a walking stick. To beg forgiveness for
wishing — no, no! — that she might finally die. -He shuddered,
began to sweat. But I am not to blame! Oh! To go away, to
plan his book on civil law, to get away from that horrible
world, so repugnantly intimate and human.
— Now I'm going to play 'Birdsong in Spring' — Cousin Isabel
informed him.
Yes, yes. I long for spring...Help me. I'm suffocating. Ridiculous
spring had never been more spring-like and joyful.
— This melody reminds me of a blue rose, she said, half
turning in his direction and smiling with a hint of perversity.
Suddenly on that dry, wrinkled face, like a vein of water in the
desert, the two little diamonds trembled on her withered ears,
two tiny moist drops that sparkled. Ah, how exceedingly fresh
and voluptuous... The old woman had possessions. But if she
wore those drop earrings it was for a reason he never
discovered: she herself had bought the diamonds and arranged
to have them mounted as earrings, she carried them like two
phantoms under her grey bristly hair.
This music reminds me of a blue rose, she had said, well
aware that only she could understand what she meant. From
experience, he knew that he should ask her to explain that
expression and patiently give her the pleasure of answering
him, biting her lower lip:
— Ah, that's my little secret.
This time, however, the exciting little game they'd played so
often, did not take place. He simply avoided looking at the old
woman and confronting her disappointment. He got up and
went to knock at his fiancée's door.
She was sewing near the window. He closed the door, locked
it and knelt down beside her. He rested his head on her
bosom and once more inhaled that tepid, cloying scent of old
roses. She continued to smile, absent, almost mysterious, as if
she were listening attentively to the gentle current of a river
flowing within her breast.
— Otávio, Otávio, she said in a hushed and distant voice. None
of the inhabitants in that household, neither his unmarried
cousin, nor Lídia, nor the servants, was alive -Otávio thought.
Not true — he corrected himself: only he was dead. But he
continued: ghosts, ghosts. Those remote voices, no expectations,
happiness.
— Lídia, he said, forgive me.
— For what? — she felt a little apprehensive.
— For everything.
She vaguely believed she should agree and remained silent.
Otávio, Otávio. It was so much easier to speak to other human
beings. Were she not so deeply in love with him, how difficult
she would find it to put up with all the misunderstandings on
his part. They only understood each other when they kissed,
when Otávio rested his head like this, on her bosom. But life
was much more drawn-out, she thought with dismay. There
would be moments when she would look straight at him
without being able to extend her hand to touch him. And then
— that oppressive silence. He would always be detached from
her and they would only be able to communicate during special
moments -moments of intense life threatened by death. But this
was not enough... Their life together was essential precisely in
order to live those other moments, she thought in terror,
struggling to reason. She would only be able to utter the
essential words to Otávio, as if he were some deity anxious to
be off. If she embarked on one of those leisurely aimless
conversations, which she so thoroughly enjoyed, she could see
him grow impatient or observe his expression become
exceedingly forbearing and heroic. Otávio, Otávio... What could
she do? His approach worked like magic, transformed her into
someone who was truly alive, the blood pulsing through her
veins. Or else it failed to rouse her. It lulled her as if he were
simply approaching by stealth to perfect her.
She knew that it was useless to take any decisions regarding
her own destiny. She had loved Otávio from the moment he
had loved her, ever since they were children, under the
contented eye of his cousin. And she would always love him. It
was useless to follow other paths, when her steps were guiding
her along only one. Even when he wounded her, she took
refuge in him against him. She was so weak. Instead of
suffering upon recognizing her weakness, she rejoiced: she
somehow knew, without being able to explain it, that from this
weakness came her support for Otávio. She sensed that he
was suffering, that he was hiding something alive and distressed
in his soul and that she could only help him by explaining all
the passiveness that lay dormant in her being.
Sometimes she secretly rebelled: life is so drawn-out... She
feared the days, one after another, without any surprises, days
of total devotion to one man. To a man who would use up all
his wife's resources for his own passion, in a tranquil
unconscious sacrifice of everything except his own individuality.
It was a sham rebellion, a bid for freedom which left her
terrified, above all, of victory. She tried for several days to
assume an attitude of independence, something which she could
only achieve with limited success in the morning when she
woke up and before setting eyes on the man. It only required
his presence, even its anticipation, to annihilate her completely,
and reduce her to waiting. At night, alone in the room, she
longed for him. Every nerve and muscle in her body aching.
Then she became resigned. Resignation was sweet and fresh.
She had been born for resignation.
Otávio examined her dark hair, discreetly combed back behind
her large unsightly ears. He examined her body as firm and
compact as the trunk of a tree, her hands firm and attractive.
And, once more, like the bland refrain of a song, he asked
himself again: 'What binds me to her?' He felt sorry for Lídia,
he knew that even without any motive, even without knowing
any other woman, even if she were the only woman, he would
abandon her at some point. Perhaps even tomorrow. Why not?
— Do you know something! — he said — I dreamt about you
last night.
She opened her eyes, glowing from head to foot:
— Did you really! Tell me about it.
— I dreamt that we were strolling together through a meadow
filled with flowers, that I was gathering lilies for you and that
you were dressed all in white.
— What a pleasant dream...
— Yes, most pleasant...
— Otávio.
— Yes?...
— I hope you won't mind my asking? When are we going to
get married! There is nothing to stop us... I must know in
order to start making preparations.
— Is that the only reason?
She blushed, happy to be able to speak of something that
might make her appear more attractive. She made a clumsy
effort to appear coquettish:
— Yes for that reason and... besides, I'm tired of waiting. It's
all so difficult.
— I understand. But I can't say when.
— But why not immediately? You should have decided... It's a
long time since...
Otávio stood up abruptly and said:
— Can't you see that I'm lying? That I wasn't dreaming about
you?
She looked at him in dismay, her face drained of colour.
— You're making fun of me...
— No, I'm serious. I didn't dream about you.
— What did you dream about?
— About no one. I slept soundly without dreaming about
anything.
She went back to her sewing.
 
 
Joana ran her hand over the bitch's swollen belly, stroking it
with slender fingers. She paused, quickly paying attention.
— She's pregnant — she said.
And there was something in her expression, in those hands
fondling the bitch's body that linked her directly to reality,
laying it bare; as if both of them formed one continuous mass.
The woman and the bitch were there, alive and naked, with
something ferocious in their communion. She speaks in such
precise terms that it is terrifying, Otávio thought uneasily,
suddenly feeling himself to be useless and effeminate. And this
was when he was seeing her for the first time.
He observed that there was a brittle, crystalline quality about
her that attracted and repelled him at the same time. Even the
way she moved. Without showing any feeling or liking for her
own body, but hurling it dispassionately like an insult for all to
see. Otávio watched her move and reflected that not even
physically was she the type of woman he fancied. He preferred
neat little bodies, perfect in every detail, unsensational. Or big
bodies, like that of his fiancée, set and mute. What he might
say to them would suffice. Those lines of Joana, so fragile,
barely outlined, were disquieting. Those lines were so suggestive,
her big eyes incandescent. She was not pretty, much too thin.
Even her sensuality must be different from his, because it was
much too luminous.
Otávio tried, from the first moment he met her, not to lose
any of her details, saying to himself: let no tender feelings
crystallize inside me; I must study her carefully. But, as she
knew she was being watched, Joana turned to him at that
very moment, smiling, cold, not exactly passive. And foolishly he
reacted, he spoke, confused and anxious to obey her. Instead
of obliging her to drop her mask and so destroy herself in his
power. And despite that air of someone who is ignorant of the
simplest things, as at their very first meeting, she had thrown
him back within himself! She had thrown him back into his
own intimacy, coldly forgetting the little, comfortable formulae
that sustained him and helped him to communicate with people.
Joana told him...
... The old man drew near, his enormous body swaying, his
head completely bald. He came up to her with pouting lips and
bulging eyes, his voice tearful. He said, affecting a childish
stammer:
— I've hurt myself... It's sore... I rubbed on some ointment, it's
getting a little better...
He rolled his eyes and those flabby mounds of blubber began
to quiver, the shine on his wet pouting lips gleamed softly.
Joana leaned over ever so slightly and saw his bare gums.
— Won't you say you feel sorry for me?
She looked at him gravely. He betrayed no surprise:
— Aren't you going to say 'poor little thing'?
The sight of this short man with his protruding bottom and
plaintive eyes that spoke of timid continence left her amused
and bewildered. She said nothing. Then slowly, in the same
tone of voice:
— Poor little thing.
He laughed, considered the joke over and done with and
turned and made for the door. Joana's eyes followed him, she
leaned slightly forwards to get a better look the moment he
withdrew from the table. She confronted him erect and aloof,
her eyes wide open and bright. She looked at the table,
rummaged for a second, picked up a small, thick book. No
sooner had he put his hand on the latch than he received it
on the back of his neck, with full force. He turned round at
once, his hand on his head, wide-eyed with pain and fright.
Joana remained in the same position. Well, she thought, at
least he's lost that nauseating expression. It's only right that an
old man should suffer.
She said in a loud, ingratiating voice:
— Forgive me. There's a tiny lizard there, right over the door.
— A brief pause. — I missed my aim.
The old man continued to stare at her without understanding.
Then a vague terror gripped him, confronted by that smiling
face.
— Goodbye... It was nothing... My God!
— Goodbye...
When the door closed, she lingered there with that smile on
her face. She gave a little shrug. She went up to the window,
her expression weary and vacant:
— Perhaps I should listen to some music.
 
— Yes, it's true, I threw the book at him, Joana replied in
answer to Otávio's question.
He tried to get the upper hand:
— But that's not what you told the old man!
— No, I lied.
Otávio stared at her, looked in vain for some remorse, for
some sign of confession.
— Only after having lived more or better, shall I succeed in
discounting what is human, Joana sometimes told him. Human
— me. Human — people taken separately as individuals. I must
forget them because my relations with them can only be
sentimental. If I go in search of them, I demand or give them
the equivalent of those familiar words we are always hearing,
fraternity and justice. If they have any real value, it's not
because they constitute the apex but rather the base of a
triangle. They are the condition and not the fact in itself. Yet
they end up by swamping our every thought and emotion
because fraternity and justice are unattainable, they are
contrary to nature. Despite everything, they are fatal, given the
state of promiscuity in which we live. In this state, hatred
transforms itself into love, which never really goes beyond a
search for love, never realized except in theory, as in
Christianity.
— Oh, spare me, Otávio cried out. She would have liked to
stop but weariness and the excitement provoked by the man's
presence stimulated her mind, and the words poured out
endlessly.
— Discounting what is human is difficult, she continued, difficult
to escape this atmosphere of frustrated revolt -adolescence —
this solidarity with men who share the same sense of
frustration and failure. Yet how nice it would be to build
something pure, free from false, sublimated love, free from the
fear of not loving... The fear of not loving, worse than the fear
of not being loved...
Oh, spare me, Joana could hear in Otávio's silence. But at the
same time she liked to think aloud, to reason things out
spontaneously, simply following her intuition. Sometimes, even
for sheer pleasure, she invented arguments: if a stone falls
then that stone exists, there was a force that caused it to fall,
a place from which it fell, a place through which it fell  — I
believe that nothing has escaped the nature of the fact, save
for the mystery itself of the fact. But now she was also talking
because she did not know how to surrender and, above all,
because she merely foresaw, without understanding, that Otávio
could embrace her and bring her peace.
— One night, no sooner had I settled down, she told him,
when one of the legs of the bed broke, throwing me on to the
floor. After a moment of anger, for I was not even sleepy
enough to dispense with comfort, I suddenly thought to myself:
Why should a bed be intact and not be broken? I got back
into bed and was soon asleep...
She was not pretty. Sometimes it was as if her spirit were
abandoning her only to reveal — Otávio suspected — what
could never be discovered, even by some superhuman vigilance.
On the face that then emerged, the limited and unfortunate
traits had no intrinsic beauty. Nothing remained of her former
mystery except the colour of her skin, milky, sombre, elusive. If
the moments of abandon prolonged themselves and succeeded
each other, then he was amazed at her ugliness, a kind of
abasement and brutality, some blind and irrevocable thing that
took possession of Joana's body as if it were decomposing.
Yes, I know, Joana continued. The distance that separates
feelings from words. I've already thought about this. And the
most curious thing of all is that the moment I try to speak,
not only do I fail to express what I am feeling, but what I am
feeling slowly transforms itself into what I am saying. Or at
least what makes me act is certainly not what I am feeling but
what I am saying.
He had no sooner met her than she told him about the old
man, told him about the bitch expecting pups and, suddenly
alarmed, he had felt as if he had just made a confession, as if
he had revealed to that stranger the story of his entire life.
What life? The one that struggled inside him and that was
nothing, he repeated to himself, afraid of appearing before his
own eyes as being self-important and burdened with
responsibilities. — He was nothing, nothing, and was therefore
free to do nothing, he repeated to himself, his eyes mentally
shut. — As if he had told Joana what he could only perceive
in the dark. And most surprising of all: as if she had listened
and then laughed, pardoning him — not like God, but like the
devil — opening wide gates to allow him to pass.
Especially when he had touched her, he had understood:
whatever might follow between them would be irremediable. For
when he had embraced her, he had felt her come alive in his
arms like running water. And seeing her so alive, he had
understood, overwhelmed and secretly pleased, that if she loved
him, there was nothing he could do... At that moment when
he had finally kissed her, he had felt himself to be suddenly
free, pardoned beyond what he knew of himself, pardoned in
what lay beneath everything, he was...
From then onwards there was no choice. He had plunged
giddily from Lídia to Joana. Knowing this helped him to love
her. It was not difficult. On one occasion she had become
distracted looking through the window-pane, her lips parted,
oblivious of herself. He had called her and the gentle, forlorn
manner in which she had turned her head and said: eh?...
had made him fall into himself, sinking into a foolish and
obscure wave of love. Otávio had then turned his face away,
anxious to avoid looking at her.
He could love her, he could accept the new and
incomprehensible adventure she was offering him. But he
continued holding on to the first impulse which had thrown
him against her. It was not as a woman, it was not like this,
submissive, that he wanted her... He needed her cold and
assured. So that he could say as he used to say when he was
a little boy, protected and triumphant: It's not my fault...
They would marry, they would see each other at every
moment and he would recognize that she was worse than him.
And strong, in order to teach him not to be afraid. Not even
to be afraid of loving... He wanted her not in order to make a
life together, but so that she might allow him to live. To rise
above himself, above his past, above the petty villainies which
he had committed with cowardice and to which he was still
attached in a cowardly way. Otávio thought that on Joana's
side he would be able to go on sinning.
When Otávio had kissed her, he had held her hands, pressing
them against his chest, Joana had bitten her lips, at first
enraged, because she still didn't know with which thought she
should clothe that violent sensation, like a cry surging from her
breast and making her feel dizzy. She looked at him without
seeing him, her eyes clouded, her body martyred. They had to
make their farewell. She withdrew abruptly and went off
without turning back, without any nostalgia.
Back in her room, lying undressed on the bed, she was unable
to sleep. Her body felt oppressive, existed beyond her like
some stranger. She felt it throbbing, feverish. She put out the
light and closed her eyes, she tried to escape, to sleep. But she
lay there for many hours, examining herself, watching the blood
creep sluggishly through her veins like an inebriated animal.
And thinking. How little she had known herself until now.
Those light, slender forms, those delicate lines of adolescence.
They were opening up, breathing as if they were suffocating
and ready to explode.
As dawn broke, the gentle breeze caressed her bed and ruffled
the curtains. Joana gradually calmed down. The freshness of
early morning consoled her aching body. She was slowly
overcome with weariness and, suddenly exhausted, she fell into
a deep sleep.
She woke up late and felt happy. She imagined that every cell
in her body had burst into flower. Miraculously, all her
resources of strength were aroused and ready for battle. When
she thought of Otávio, she breathed cautiously, as if the
atmosphere might be harmful. During the days that followed,
she neither saw him nor attempted to see him. She avoided
him as if his presence were superfluous.
And she was so completely physical, that she was pure spirit.
Incorporeal, she passed through events and hours, weaving
between them with the swiftness of an instant. She scarcely
took any nourishment and her sleep was as tenuous as a veil.
She woke up frequently during the night, unconcerned,
preparing to smile before giving it any thought.
She went back to sleep without changing her position, simply
closing her eyes. She often searched for herself without vanity.
Her smooth complexion, her bright lips made her turn her
back on her image almost out of shame, without the strength
to go on confronting that woman's gaze, fresh and moist, so
subtly open and assured.
The happiness ceased.
Plenitude became sad and oppressive and Joana was a cloud
ready to turn to rain. She breathed with difficulty as if there
were no room inside her for air. She paced up and down,
perplexed by the change. How? — she asked herself and felt
that she was being ingenuous. Were there two sides to this?
Was she suffering for the same reason that had made her
terribly happy?
She carried her diseased body with her, a troublesome wound
by day. Lightheartedness was replaced by gloom and fatigue.
Satisfied — an animal that had quenched its thirst, filling its
body with water. Yet anxious and unhappy as if despite
everything there were still lands without water, arid and
parched. Above all, she suffered from misunderstanding, alone,
dumbfounded. Until leaning her head against the window-pane
— the street peaceful, the evening drawing in, the world outside
there — she felt moisture on her face. She wept freely, as if
this were the solution. Large tears ran down her cheeks,
without her moving a single facial muscle. She wept so
profusely that she couldn't speak. Afterwards she felt as if she
had reverted to her real proportions, tiny, shrunken, humble.
Serenely empty. She was prepared.
She then looked for him. And her new glory and suffering
were now more intense and somehow more unbearable.
She got married.
Love came to confirm all the familiar things of whose existence
she only knew without ever having accepted and experienced
them. The world revolved beneath her feet, there were two
sexes among humans, a thin line linked hunger to satisfaction,
the love of animals, torrential waters coursed towards the sea,
children were creatures in the process of growing up, in the
soil the bud would transform itself into plant. She would no
longer be able to deny... what? — she asked herself in
suspense. The luminous centre of things, the affirmation
dormant beneath everything, the harmony that existed beneath
what she did not understand.
She awoke to a new morning, blissfully alive. And her joy was
as pure as the sun's reflection on the water. Each event
vibrated in her body like little glass needles that were
splintering. After some moments, fleeting and profound, she
lived tranquilly for a long time, understanding, accepting,
resigning herself to everything. It seemed to her that she
formed part of the real world and that she had mysteriously
distanced herself from other human beings. Notwithstanding
that during this period she was able to extend her hand to
them with a fraternity whose vital source could be felt. They
spoke to her of their own sorrows and she, although she
might not hear, think or speak, wore a kind expression —
shining and mysterious like that of a pregnant woman.
What was happening then? Miraculously she was alive, relieved
of all memories. Her entire past had evaporated. And even the
present was one of mists, sweet, fresh mists, separating her
from solid reality, preventing her from touching it. Were she to
pray, were she to think, it would be to give thanks for having
a body made for love. The only truth became that tenderness
into which she had sunk. Her face was vague and ill-defined,
floating among all the other opaque and confident faces, as if it
were not yet able to find support in any expression. Her whole
body and soul lost their boundaries, they merged and fused
into a single chaos, gentle and amorphous, relaxed and with
uncertain movements, like matter that was simply alive. It was
perfect renewal, creation.
And her union with the earth was so deep and her certainty
so firm — about what? what? — that she could now lie
without surrendering. All this left her thinking at times: Dear
God, perhaps I am making more of this than of love?
She gradually became accustomed to her new state, she
became accustomed to breathing, to living. Little by little, she
started becoming older in herself, she opened her eyes and
once more she was a statue, no longer plastic, yet defined.
From afar, disquiet was reawakening. At night, between the
sheets, the slightest movement or unexpected thought awakened
her to herself. Mildly surprised, she opened her eyes wide,
perceived her own body plunged into reassuring contentment.
She wasn't suffering, but where was she?
— Joana... Joana... she softly called to herself. And her body
scarcely responded, quietly echoing: Joana.
The days sped by and she wished to confront herself more
closely. She now summoned herself in a loud voice, and it was
not enough that she should be breathing. Happiness was
effacing her, effacing her... She now wanted to know herself
again, even with sorrow. But she became increasingly
submerged. Tomorrow she put it off, tomorrow I shall confront
myself. But the new day skimmed over her surface, light as a
summer evening, barely unsettling her nerves.
The only thing she had not got used to was sleeping. Each
night, sleep became an adventure, to fall from the effortless
clarity in which she lived into mystery itself, sombre and fresh,
to cross darkness. To die and to be reborn.
So I shall never have any mandate, she thought to herself
after she had been married for several months. I slip from one
truth to another, always forgetting the first one, always
dissatisfied. Her life consisted of tiny, complete lives, of perfect
circles, that became isolated from each other. Except that at
the end of each of them, instead of dying and beginning life
on another plane, inorganic or organically deficient, Joana
recommenced on the human plane itself. Only the fundamental
notes were different. Or was it only the supplementary ones
that were different while the basic ones were eternally the
same?
It was ever futile to have been happy or unhappy. And even
to have loved. No happiness or unhappiness had been so
intense that it could have transformed the elements of her
matter, giving her a unique path — as one's true path ought
to be. I perpetually go on inaugurating myself, opening and
closing circles of life, throwing them aside, withered,
impregnated with the past. Why are they so independent, why
don't they merge into one solid mass and provide me with
ballast? The fact is that they were far too integral. Moments so
intense, red, condensed within themselves that they needed
neither past nor future in order to exist. They brought an
awareness that did not serve as experience, a direct awareness,
closer to feeling than perception. The truth then revealed was
so true that it couldn't endure save in its recipient, in the very
fact which had provoked it. So true, so fatal, that it only
existed in function of its origin. Once the moment of life is
over the corresponding truth is also exhausted. I cannot mould
it, make it inspire other such moments. Consequently nothing
compromises me.
Meanwhile, the justification of her short-lived glory perhaps had
no value other than that of affording her a certain pleasure in
reasoning things out, such as: if a stone falls, that stone exists,
that stone fell from somewhere, that stone... She was often so
mistaken.
 
 
Part Two
 
The Marriage
Joana suddenly remembered, without any forewarning, herself
standing at the top of the stairs. She did not know if she had
once been looking down from the top of a staircase, crammed
with lots of people, dressed in satin, with large fans. Most likely
she had never actually experienced this. The fans, for example,
had no material consistency in her memory. If she tried to
think of them, she didn't really see fans, but shiny blotches
swimming back and forth amidst words in French, whispered
carefully through pursed lips, pouting like this as if a kiss were
being blown from afar. The fan began as a fan and ended
with words in French. Ridiculous. So it was a lie.
Yet despite everything, the impression persisted as if the most
important thing lay beyond the staircase and the fans. She
stopped moving for a moment and only her eyes blinked
rapidly, in pursuit of some sensation. Ah, yes. She descended
the marble staircase, feeling in the soles of her feet that cold
fear of slipping, her hands hot and perspiring, the ribbon
tightening round her waist, pulling her up like a hoist. Then
the smell of new clothes, the bright inquisitive glance of a man
eyeing her up and down and leaving her, as if a button had
been pressed in the dark, lighting up her body. She was
pervaded by long, integral muscles. Any thought descended
through those smooth tendons only to tremble there in her
ankles whose flesh was as tender as that of young fowl.
She paused on the bottom step, securely and without danger,
she placed the palm of her hand gently on the cold, smooth
banister. And without knowing why, she felt a sudden
happiness, almost painful, a weakness in her heart, as if it
were soft pulp and someone was poking fingers into it,
kneading it gently. Why? She raised her hand weakly in a
gesture of refusal. She did not wish to know. But now the
question had surfaced and in absurd reply came the shining
banister impulsively tossed from on high like a glossy streamer
during carnival time. But it was not carnival time, for there was
silence in the room, a silence through which everything could
be seen. The humid reflections of the lamps over the mirrors,
the ladies' brooches and the buckles on the gentlemen's belts
communicating from time to time with the chandelier, through
subtle rays of light.
She began to perceive the ambience. Between the men and
women there were no hard spaces, everything blended softly.
Vapour, humid and exciting, rose from some invisible heater.
Once again, she felt a slight pain in her heart, and she smiled,
her nose wrinkled, her breathing faint.
She paused for a moment's rest. She began recovering slowly,
regaining some sense of reality, despite her efforts to the
contrary, her body once more insensible, opaque and strong,
like something that has been alive for some considerable time.
She could make out the room, the curtains waving ironically,
the bed obstinately still and useless. She anxiously tried to take
herself to the top of the staircase and to descend once more.
She could feel herself walking, but no longer felt her legs
shaking, or her hands perspiring. Then she saw that her
memory had drained.
She waited near the bookcase, where she had gone to look
for... what? She frowned, not really interested. What? She tried
to derive some amusement from the impression that in the
middle of her forehead there was now a gaping hole where
they had extracted the notion of whatever she had gone to
look for.
She turned towards the door and asked in a low voice, eyes
closed:
— What was it you wanted, Otávio?
— The one about Civil Law, he said, and before getting back
to his notebook, he gave her a quick look of surprise.
She brought him the book, distracted, her movements slow. He
waited for it with outstretched hand, without lifting his head.
She lingered for a moment, holding the book out in his
direction, keeping it at a distance. But Otávio didn't notice the
delay and with a tiny shrug she put the book into his hand.
She sat down uncomfortably in a nearby chair, as if about to
depart at any moment. Gradually, since nothing was happening,
she leaned back submissively, her eyes vacant, thinking of
nothing.
Otávio continued reading about Civil Law, pausing over some
line and then impatiently biting his nail and quickly turning
several pages at a time. Until he stopped once more, absorbed,
passing his tongue over the edge of his teeth, one hand gently
pulling the hairs of his eyebrows. Some word or other
immobilized him, his hand in mid-air, his mouth open like that
of a dead fish. Suddenly he threw the book down with a thud.
His eyes bright and eager, he wrote hastily in his notebook,
stopping for a moment to take a deep breath, and, with a
gesture which startled her, began tapping on his teeth with his
knuckles.
What an animal, she thought. He interrupted what he was
writing and looked at her in terror, as if she had thrown
something at him. She went on staring at him unintentionally
and Otávio stirred in his chair, simply reflecting that he was
not alone. He smiled, diffident and annoyed, and held out his
hand to her across the table. She leaned forward in her chair
and offered him in turn the tips of her fingers. Otávio
squeezed them rapidly, smiling, and then suddenly, before she
even had time to withdraw her arm, he returned abruptly to
his notebook, almost burying his face in it and writing furiously.
He was the one who was feeling now, Joana thought. And
suddenly, perhaps out of envy, without any thought, she hated
him with such brute force that her hands were gripping the
arms of the chair and her teeth were clenched. She panted for
a few seconds, reinvigorated. Fearing that her husband might
sense those seconds, force her to disguise her hatred and so
diminish the strength of her feelings. He was to blame, she
thought coldly, looking out for a fresh wave of anger. He was
to blame, he was to blame. His presence and more than his
presence: the knowledge that he existed robbed her of any
freedom. Only on rare occasions now, in some fleeting
escapade, was she able to feel anything. That's right. He was
to blame. How had she not discovered it before? — she asked
herself in triumph. He was robbing her of everything,
everything. And as if the phrase were still weak, she thought
with intensity, her eyes closed, everything! She felt better, she
could think more clearly.
Before he appeared she had always had her hands
outstretched and how much, oh how much she received to her
surprise! To her overwhelming surprise, like a ray of sweet
surprise, like a shower of tiny lights... Now all her time was
devoted to him and she felt that any minutes she could call
her own had been conceded, broken into little ice-cubes which
she must swallow quickly before they melted. And whipping
herself into a gallop: look, that time is freedom! Look, think
quickly, look, pull yourself together quickly, look, it's gone! Now
— only much later, the tray of ice-cubes once more and
yourself looking at it in fascination, watching the drops of water
already trickling.
Then he came. And she rested at last, with a heavy sigh. —
But she didn't want to rest! — Her blood ran more slowly, its
rhythm domesticated, like an animal that has trained itself to fit
into a cage.
She remembered that she had gone to look for something —
what? Ah, Civil Law — in the bookcase at the top of the
stairs, such a gratuitous memory, so free, even if imagined ...
How young she was then. Clear water running within and
without. She missed that sensation, felt the need to experience
it once more. She looked anxiously up and down, searching for
something. But everything was as it had always been. Old. I'll
leave him, was her first thought, without any premonition. She
opened her eyes, watching out for herself. She knew that that
thought might bring consequences. As happened in the past,
when her resolutions didn't require great facts, merely some
trifling idea, some meaningless vision, in order to be formed. I'll
leave him, she repeated, and this time tiny fibres broke away
from her thought, attaching it to herself. From now on the
thought was inside her and the filaments thickened until they
formed roots.
How often would she reach this decision before actually leaving
him? She wore herself out in anticipation of the little struggles
she would still endure, rebelling and giving in at once, right to
the end. She experienced a rapid and impatient inner
movement which manifested itself simply with the imperceptible
raising of a hand. Otávio glanced at her for a second and
carried on writing like someone in a trance. How sensitive he
is, she thought during a pause. She went on following her own
thoughts: why hold off? Yes, why hold off? — she asked
herself. And her question was concrete, it called for a serious
reply. She sat comfortably in the chair, adopted a formal pose,
as if to hear what he had to say.
Then Otávio gave a loud sigh, closed the book and his
notebook with a slam, threw them down with unwarranted
force, his long legs stretched way out in front of him. She
looked at him alarmed and outraged. Well then... — she began
ironically. But she didn't know how to go on and waited,
watching him.
He said, with an expression of mock severity:
— Very well. Now do me the favour of coming over here and
putting your hand on this manly chest, for that's what I need
right now.
She laughed just to please him. But in the midst of her
laughter she was already finding some amusement. She
remained sitting, trying to go on: then he... and she moved
her lips in a gesture of contempt and triumph, like someone
receiving the awaited proof. Then, he... Was it like this? She
was waiting for Otávio to notice her attitude, to become aware
of her determination not to move from her chair. He, in the
meantime, as always, was aware of nothing and just at those
moments when he should be looking, he was absorbed in
something or other. Now, at this very moment, he had
remembered to retrieve the book and notebook which he had
thrown down on the table. He wasn't even looking at Joana,
was he certain that she would come to him? She smiled with
malice, thinking how he had deceived himself and how many
thoughts she had enjoyed without him even suspecting. Yes,
why hold off?
He raised his eyes, somewhat surprised at the delay. And as
she remained seated, they went on there looking at each other
from a distance. He was intrigued.
— Well? — he said disgruntled: — My manly...
Joana interrupted him with a gesture, for she could not bear
the compassion that had suddenly invaded her and the sense
of absurdity conveyed by that phrase, when she herself was so
lucid and determined to speak. He was not intimidated by her
gesture and she had to swallow carefully in order to suppress
the foolish urge to weep which slowly surfaced in her breast.
Now his pity embraced her too, and she saw the two of them
together, forlorn and childish. Both of them were going to die,
this same man who had tapped his fingers on his teeth with
such gusto. She herself, along with the top of the staircase and
all her capacity to want to feel. The essential things struck her
at such moments also during the empty ones, filling them with
meaning. How often she had given a waiter an enormous tip
simply because she had remembered that he was going to die
and didn't know.
She looked at him mysteriously, her expression grave and
tender. And now she tried to excite some emotion by thinking
of their future corpses.
She rested her head on his chest and there a heart was
beating. She thought: but even so, despite death, I shall leave
him one day. She was fully aware of the thought that might
come to her, giving her strength if she should yield to emotion
before leaving him: 'I've taken everything I could. I neither hate
nor despise him. Why look for him even though I love him?
I'm not so fond of myself as to like the things I like. I'm more
in love with what I want than with myself.' Oh, she also knew
that the truth might be contrary to what she had thought. She
let her head droop, pressed to her brow against Otávio's white
shirt. Little by little, very slowly the idea of death began to fade
and she no longer found anything to laugh at. Her heart was
softly moulded. Her hearing told her that the other one,
indifferent to everything, was pursuing its fatal path with regular
heartbeats. .. The sea.
— Hold off, simply hold off, Joana thought before she stopped
thinking. Because the last of the ice-cubes had melted, and
now she was sadly a happy woman.
 
Under the Teacher's Protection
Joana remembered it well: days before getting married she had
gone to see her teacher.
She had suddenly felt the need to meet him, to listen to him,
unyielding and cold, before going away. For in a sense, she
had the impression of betraying her entire past by marrying.
She wanted to see her teacher again, to feel his support. And
when the idea occurred to her of paying a visit, she had
calmed down, feeling relieved.
He would have to give her the right word. What word?
Nothing, she replied to herself mysteriously, wishing with sudden
faith and expectation, to wait and listen to him, completely
inexperienced, without having any idea of what she was about
to gain. This had happened to her once before: when she had
prepared herself for a visit to the circus as a little girl. The
best moments had been spent getting ready. And when she
approached the broad field where the huge, round tent loomed
white, like one of those silver domes that conceal until a certain
moment the best dish on the table, when she approached
holding the maid's hand, she felt fear and anguish and a
disquieting happiness in her heart, she wanted to go back, to
escape. When the maid told her: your father has given us
money to buy popcorn, then Joana looked at things in
wonderment, under that sunny evening sky, as if they were
hallucinating.
She knew that the teacher had become ill, that his wife had
abandoned him. But although he had aged, she found him
stouter and bright-eyed. She had also been afraid, to begin
with, that their last dinner together, when she had fled in
alarm towards puberty, might make the visit awkward, leave
them feeling uneasy, in that same strange, creepy room where
the dust had overcome the polish.
The teacher had received her with a serene, distracted air.
With those dark circles under his eyes he reminded her of an
old-fashioned portrait. He questioned Joana but the moment
she tried to answer he stopped listening, as if no longer under
any obligation. She interrupted herself a number of times, her
attention directed at the clock and the small table with the
medicines. She looked all around her and the semi-darkness
was humid and stifling. The teacher was like a great tom-cat
reigning supreme in a cellar.
— Now you can open the windows, he said. You know what I
mean, a little darkness and then plenty of fresh air; your
whole body benefits, receives a new lease of life. Just like a
neglected child. When it receives everything, it suddenly reacts,
blooms again, sometimes even more than the other children.
Joana had flung the windows and doors wide open and the
cold air entered with a triumphant blast. A little sunshine came
through the door behind him. The teacher had unbuttoned the
collar of his pyjama jacket, exposing his chest to the wind.
— It's like this, he had declared.
Looking at him, Joana discovered that he was nothing but a
fat old man sitting in the sun, his sparse hairs caught in the
breeze, his great body sprawled out in the chair. And his smile,
dear God, a smile.
When the clock struck three, he had suddenly become restless,
had halted in mid-sentence and, with measured gestures, his
expression avid and sober, had counted twenty drops from a
phial into a glass of water. He had raised it to eye-level,
observing it, his lips pursed, wholly absorbed. He had drunk
the dark liquid fearlessly, then stared at the glass with a sour
expression and a half-smile which she couldn't explain. He had
placed it on the table, had clapped his hands summoning the
house-boy, a skinny apathetic black youth. He had waited for
him to return in silence, alert, as if he were trying to listen at
a distance. Only when he had received the washed glass,
examined it carefully and turned it upside down on the saucer,
had he given a little sigh:
— Now then, what were we saying? She went on observing
him, without paying any attention to the words themselves.
Nothing in the man's expression betrayed his wife's departure.
Fleetingly, she saw that figure again which she had so feared
and detested, nearly always silent, the face aloof and imperious.
And, despite the revulsion that other woman still aroused in
her, in a moment of reminiscence Joana had discovered to her
surprise that not only then, but perhaps always, she had felt
herself united to her, as if both of them had something secret
and wicked in common.
Nothing in his appearance betrayed his wife's departure. There
was even a new-found tranquillity in his attitude, a composure
that Joana had never noticed before. She studied him almost
as anguished as waters swollen by the rain, whose depth was
now difficult to judge. She had come to hear him, to feel his
clear-sightedness like some point of anchorage!
— The torture of a strong man is greater than that of a sick
one — she had tried to make him speak. He had barely raised
his eyes. Her words had hovered in mid-air, foolish and timid.
I'll go on, it's precisely in my nature never to feel ridiculous, I
always venture on to any platform. Otávio, on the other hand,
is such a sensitive creature that it only takes a pointed smile to
demolish him and make him feel miserable. He would listen to
me, now feeling uneasy or smiling. Was Otávio already thinking
inside her? Had she already become transformed into a
woman who listens and waits for her man? She was giving up
something... She wanted to save herself, to hear the teacher, to
shake him. So this old man before her no longer remembered
everything she had told him? 'To sin against herself...'
— The sick envisage the world and the healthy possess it,
Joana had continued. The sick think they cannot because of
their illness and the strong feel that their strength is useless.
— Yes, yes, he shook his head timidly. She perceived that his
unease was only that of someone who doesn't wish to be
interrupted. She had gone on, however, to the end, her dull
voice repeating the thought she had had for a long time.
— That's why the poetry of poets who have suffered is sweet
and tender. While the poetry of others, of those who had been
deprived of nothing, is ardent, anguished and rebellious.
— Yes — he was saying, as he adjusted the loosened collar of
his pyjama jacket.
Humiliated and perplexed, she saw his dark, wrinkled neck.
Yes, he said from time to time without taking his eyes from
the clock as he searched for some support. How could she tell
him that she was about to get married?
At four o'clock, the ritual had been re-enacted. This time the
black youth ducked in order to avoid a kick in the pants, for
he had almost dropped the medicine bottle. Having missed its
target, the teacher's slipper went up into the air exposing his
naked foot with its curved, yellowing toenails. The boy had
caught the slipper and thrown it to Joana, laughing, afraid of
getting too close. After the glass had been put away, she had
ventured the first word about his illness, slowly, embarrassed,
for never before had they penetrated the intimacy of their own
circumstances: they had always understood each other on the
surface.
There was no need to try to get any closer... He had taken
up the subject, broached it gently, and with obvious satisfaction,
he carefully explained all the details. His attitude was a little
patronizing and mysterious to begin with, as if he found it
impossible to believe that she could penetrate his world. But
after a few moments, oblivious of her presence and somewhat
animated, he was already talking quite openly.
— The doctor has told me that I'm still not better. But I'm
going to be fine, I know more than any of these doctors, he
had added. After all, I'm the one who's ill...
She had finally discovered to her astonishment that he was
happy...
It was almost five o'clock. She felt that he was longing for her
to leave. But she couldn't leave him like this, she tried to press
him further. She had cruelly looked him straight in the eye. He
had repaid her with a look of mild indifference to begin with,
and then almost immediately shunned her, angry and disturbed.
 
The Little Family
Before starting to write, Otávio arranged his papers neatly on
the table, and tidied himself up. He was fond of these little
gestures and familiar habits, such as old clothes in which he
could move with earnestness and assurance. Ever since his
student days, this was how he prepared for any task. After
settling at his desk, he would put things in order and, his
conscience enlivened by the motion of the objects around him
— I mustn't get carried away by any grand ideas, I'm also a
thing — he allowed his pen to run somewhat freely to rid
himself of some persistent image or reflection that might
possibly try to accompany him and impede his train of thought.
For that reason, to work in the presence of others was torture.
He feared the absurdity of these tiny rituals yet could not get
along without them, for they sustained one as much as any
superstition. Just as in order to live, he surrounded himself
with do's and don'ts, rules and exceptions. Everything became
easier, as if taught. What was fascinating and terrifying about
Joana was precisely the freedom in which she lived, suddenly
loving certain things, or, in relation to others, completely blind,
without as much as using them. For he found himself under
an obligation when confronted with what existed. Joana was
right when she said that he needed to be possessed by
someone... You handle money with such intimacy.. .Joana had
teased him once as he was paying a bill in a restaurant and
she had caught him so unawares and given him such a fright
that, in the presence of the waiter, no doubt smirking, the
notes and coins had slipped from his hands and scattered at
his feet. Although no ironic comment followed — well, to do
her justice, Joana doesn't laugh — she still had an argument
ready from then on: but what was one to do with money
except keep it in order to spend it? He was annoyed,
embarrassed. He felt that his argument was no reply for
Joana.
The truth is that if he didn't have any money, if he didn't
possess the 'right credentials', if he didn't love order, if the
Law Journal didn't exist, the vague outline of his book on
Civil Law, if Lídia were not separate from Joana, if Joana was
not a woman and he was not a man, if... oh, God, if
everything... what would he do? No, not 'what would he do?',
but to whom would he turn, how would he decide. Impossible
to slip between the blocks without seeing them, without needing
them...
Breaking the rule he adopted when working — a concession —
he took up pen and paper before he was actually ready. But
he excused himself, he didn't want to lose that note, it might
come in handy some day: 'One needs to be blind to some
extent in order to perceive certain things. Perhaps that is the
mark of the artist. Any man is capable of knowing more than
he does and of reasoning with confidence, according to the
truth. But it's precisely those things which escape one in the
light. In the dark, they become phosphorescent.'
He thought a little. Then, despite the concession going on for
too long, he jotted down: 'It's not the degree that separates
intelligence from genius, but the quality. Genius is not so much
a question of intellectual power, but the form in which that
power manifests itself.' So one can easily be more intelligent
than a genius. But he's the genius. How childish that he's the
genius. I must see if I can apply this discovery in relation to
Spinoza. — Was it really him? Every idea that occurred to him,
for he would familiarize himself with it within seconds, came
with the fear that he might have stolen it.
Fine, now for some order. Having laid aside his pencil, he told
himself, I must get rid of these obsessions. One, two, three! I
deeply regret suffering as I do amidst the bamboos of the
north-east of this city, he began. I do as I please — he
continued — and no one is forcing me to write the Divine
Comedy. There is no way of being other than the way it is,
the rest is useless embroidery and just as embarrassing as
those heavily embroidered angels and flowers with which cousin
Isabel used to decorate my pillows. When I was distracted and
she would come like a purple, idiotic cloud, guess what I'm
thinking, say what, what four more times, what, what, what,
what. Like this, like this, don't run away: 'What did you say?
You're still alive? You're still not dead?' Yes, yes, that was it, I
mustn't run away from myself, I mustn't run away from my
handwriting, how delicate and horrid it is, a spider's web, I
mustn't run away from my defects, I adore you. My virtues
are so few, like those of other men, my defects, my negative
side is as beautiful and hollow as any abyss. What I am not
would leave an enormous hole in the ground. I don't conceal
my mistakes, while Joana doesn't make mistakes, there is the
difference. Eh, eh, say something, fellow. The women look at
me, the women, the women, my mouth, I let my moustache
grow again, they die of happiness and a deep love filled with
plums and prunes. I buy all of them without money, money I
keep. If one of them slips on a banana-skin there in the road,
all one can do is to feel ashamed. Nothing is lost, nothing is
nurtured. The man who can feel this, in other words, who
doesn't simply understand, but adores, should be as happy as
the man who truly believes in God. In the beginning it hurts a
little, but then you get used to it. The person writing this page
was born one day. It is now precisely a few minutes past
seven in the morning. There is mist outside, beyond the
window, the Open Window, the grand symbol. Joana would
say: I feel myself to be so inside the world that I appear not
to be thinking, to be adopting a new method of breathing.
Farewell. Such is the world, I am me, it's raining in the world,
it's a lie, I'm someone who works with my intellect, Joana is
asleep in the bedroom, someone must be waking up at this
moment, Joana would say: another is dying, another is listening
to music, someone has gone into the bathroom, such is the
world. I intend to arouse the feelings of everyone, to call upon
them to share my compassion. I live with a woman who is
naked and cold, I mustn't escape, I mustn't escape, who looks
into my eyes, I mustn't escape, who watches me, it's a lie, it's
a lie, but it's the truth. Now she's in bed sleeping, she's
overcome with sleep, overcome, overcome. She is a slender
bird in a white nightdress. I intend to arouse the feelings of
everyone, I don't conceal my mistakes, but let everyone shield
me.
He sat up straight, patted his hair down, remained serious.
Now he was going to work. As if everyone were standing by
and nodding with approval, closing his eyes in agreement. Yes,
that's right, very good. Someone real was disturbing him and
on his own he became frustrated and nervous. For 'everyone'
was looking on. He gave a little cough. He cautiously moved
away the inkwell. He began: 'The tragedy of modern times is
man's vain attempt to adapt to the state of things he has
created.'
He sat back in his chair, looked at his notebook, straightened
his pyjamas. 'Imagination is so essential to man—Joana once
more — that his entire world finds its raison d'être in the
beauty of creation and not in its utility, not in being the result
of a series of objectives conforming to his needs. That is why
we find an increasing number of remedies aimed at uniting
man to existing ideas and institutions — education, for example,
which is so difficult — and why we continually find him outside
the world he has created. Man builds houses to look at, not to
live in. For everything follows the path of inspiration.
Determinism is not a determinism of objectives, but a strict
determinism of causes. To play, to invent, to pursue the ant to
its ant-hill, to mix water with lime in order to see the result,
that's what one does when one is small and when one is
grown up. It's a mistake to believe that we attain a high level
of pragmatism and materialism. In truth, pragmatism — the
plan directed towards a genuine and given objective — would
be understanding, stability, happiness, the greatest victory of
adaptation which man can hope to achieve. Meanwhile to do
things "so that" strikes me, in the face of reality, as being the
kind of perfection one cannot expect of man. The beginning of
everything he construes is "so that". Man's curiosity, dreams,
imagination — these have formed the modern world. Following
his inspiration, man has blended these ingredients, invented
combinations. His tragedy: to have to nourish himself with
them. He was confident that he might be able to imagine in
one life and find himself in another, set apart. In fact, that
other life continues, but its purification over the imagined one
works slowly and a man on his own cannot find foolish
thought on one side and the peace of the true life on the
other. One cannot think with impunity.' Joana thought without
fear and without reprisal. Would she finally possess madness,
or what? She could not tell. Perhaps only suffering.
He paused, re-read what he had written. Don't step outside
this world, he thought with a certain ardour. Not to have to
confront the rest. Simply to think. Simply to think and go on
writing. He didn't mind being asked to write articles on
Spinoza, so long as no one obliged him to plead in court, to
look at and contend with those offensively human beings lining
up and shamelessly revealing themselves.
He re-read his notes from earlier readings. The pure scientist
stops believing in what he likes. The need to like things: the
mark of mankind. — One must not forget: 'the intellecual love
of God' is the true knowledge and excludes any mysticism or
idolatry.
— Many answers can be found in Spinoza's statements. In the
idea, for example, that there can be thought without extension
(the modality of God) and vice-versa, surely the soul's mortality
is affirmed? Of course it is: mortality as a distinct and
reasoning soul, the clear impossibility of the pure form
attributed to the angels by St Thomas Aquinas. Mortality in
relation to the human. Immortality through the transformation
in nature. — Within the world there is no place for other
creations. There is merely the opportunity of reintegration and
continuation. All that could exist already exists. There is nothing
more to be created unless revealed. If the more man evolves,
the more he tries to synthesize, to abstract and establish
principles and laws for his life, how could God — in any
acceptance, even that of the conscious God of religions — be
without absolute laws for his own perfection? A God endowed
with free will is inferior to a God with only one law. Just as a
concept is all the truer when it is only one and does not need
to be transformed before each particular case. God's perfection
is more readily proved with the impossibility than the possibility
of miracles. To work miracles, for a God rendered human by
religions, is to be unjust — thousands of people have the same
need of this miracle at the same time — or to recognize an
error, amending it — which, more than an act of kindness or
'proof of character', means to have erred. — Neither
understanding nor volition pertain to God's nature, Spinoza
affirms. That makes me feel happier and gives me greater
freedom. For the idea of the existence of a conscious God
leaves us horribly dissatisfied.
At the top of my essay I should put a literal translation from
Spinoza: 'Bodies distinguish themselves from each other in
relation to substance.' He had shown the phrase to Joana.
Why? He shrugged his shoulders, without seeking any deeper
explanation. She had shown herself to be curious, she had
wanted to read the book.
Otávio reached out his hand and grabbed it. There was a
sheet of notepaper inserted between the pages. He looked at it
and discovered Joana's indistinct handwriting. He couldn't resist
looking closer: 'The beauty of words: the abstract nature of
God. Just like listening to Bach.' Why did he prefer not to
have written this phrase? Joana always caught him unawares.
He felt embarrassed as if she were clearly lying and he was
forced to deceive her, by saying that he believed her...
To read what she had written was like standing before Joana.
He evoked her, and avoiding her eyes, he saw her in
moments of distraction, her face white, vague and delicate. And
suddenly, a great sadness descended upon him. What am I
doing after all? he asked himself, and he didn't know why he
had so suddenly rounded on himself. No, you mustn't write
today. And since that was a concession, an order not to be
questioned — he questioned himself: if he wanted to, could he
honestly work? and the reply was definite: no — and once the
decision was more powerful than himself, he felt almost happy.
Today, someone was giving him respite. Not God. Not God, but
someone. Someone very powerful.
He would get up, tidy his papers, put the book back on the
shelf, get into some warm clothes, go and see Lídia. The
consolation of Order. How would Lídia receive him? Before the
open window, watching the children walk to school, he saw
himself take her by the shoulders, suddenly in a temper,
perhaps a little forced, when confronted by that same question:
what am I doing after all?
— Aren't you afraid? — he had screamed at her.
Lídia had remained impassive.
— Aren't you afraid of your future, of our future, of me?
Don't you realize that... that... being simply my lover... the only
place you have is at my side?
She had shaken her head, surprised and tearful:
— But no...
He had given her a good shake, remotely ashamed at having
shown so much force, when in the company of Joana, for
example, he would say nothing.
— Aren't you afraid that I might leave you? Don't you realize
that if I should leave you, you would be a woman without a
husband, without anything... A poor devil... who one day was
jilted by her fiancé and then became his mistress when he
married another...
— I don't want you to leave me...
— Ah...
—... but I'm not afraid.
He had looked at her in amazement. She was getting thinner,
he noticed. But she still looked healthy. Despite everything, she
was more nervous, much given to weeping, readily became
emotional. Suddenly, he had burst out laughing.
— Honestly, I don't know what to make of you. Lídia, too,
had laughed, glad that it was all over. He had been intimidated
by her radiant expression, he had drawn her close to him
rather than look into those eyes. And they stood there for a
moment in each other's arms, wishing for different things.
And now? Lídia would receive him as always. He wrote a note
to Joana, letting her know that he wouldn't be home for lunch.
Poor Joana... he could tell her if he wished. She would never
know. So completely wrapped up in her blind conceit... But he
would protect her ferociously, he laughed, his heart pounding.
Never mind, tomorrow he would write something definitive for
his article.
He looked at himself in the mirror before leaving, with
half-closed eyes he observed his well-shaped face, his straight
nose, his full, fleshy lips. But after all, I'm not to blame for
anything, he said. Not even for having been born. And
suddenly he didn't understand how he ever came to believe in
responsibility, to feel that constant weight at every hour. He
was free... How simple everything became at times.
He made his way on to the street, went to buy some sweets
which he chose carefully. He finally decided on a fairly large
bag of boiled sweets, apricot-flavoured. The moment he got
round the corner, he would suck the first sweet, his hands in
his pockets. His eyes filled with tenderness at the thought. Why
not? — he asked himself, suddenly irritated. Who said that
great men don't eat sweets? Only in biographies are those
details never mentioned. Suppose Joana were to know what he
was thinking? No, to be frank, she had never been sarcastic
about... He felt a moment of anger, began walking more
quickly.
Before turning the corner, he took the bag of sweets and
emptied them into the gutter. In distress, he watched them
merge with the mud, roll to a dark opening, covered with
cobwebs.
He continued on his way, walking more slowly, shrunken. It
was a little cold. Now someone would be satisfied, he thought
remotely. Like a punishment, a confession.
— Even great men are only truly recognized and honoured
once they are dead. Why? Because those who praise them
need to feel themselves somehow superior to the person
praised, they need to feel they are making some concession.
From which... there stems a patent superiority... the person
who is praising... has succeeded in holding his own ... there is
even a certain condescension... that finishes up as... pity, Otávio
told her.
Lídia was observing him in one of his ugly moments. Those
thin lips, that wrinkled forehead, his foolish expression — Otávio
was thinking. And she loved him at this moment. His ugliness
neither excited her nor aroused her pity. It simply drew her
closer to him and with greater happiness. The happiness of
wholly accepting, of feeling that she was uniting all that was
true and primitive in herself to someone, independent of any
preconceived ideas about beauty. She recalled her former
schoolmates — those girls who were always so lively, who
knew everything, were up to date with the latest films, books,
love affairs, fashions, those girls with whom she had never
really had much in common, withdrawn as she was, never
really having much to say for herself. She remembered them
and felt certain that they would find Otávio ugly at this
moment. For she accepted him to such an extent that she
would have preferred him even uglier in order to give even
greater proof of her effortless love.
She looked at him, paying no attention to what he was saying.
It was reassuring and good to know that between the two of
them there were secrets weaving to a delicate transparent life
over that other life which was real. Who would ever have
imagined that Otávio had once kissed her on the eyelids, that
he had felt her eyelashes on his lips and been forced to smile?
And miraculously she had understood everything without either
of them saying a word. Who would have guessed that one day
they had loved each other so much that they had remained
quite silent, grave and still? Both of them gathered inner
knowledge no outsider ever probed. He had gone away one
day. But it didn't matter all that much. She knew that they
both had 'secrets', that they were both irremediably accomplices.
Were he to leave her, were he to love another woman, he
would leave her and love another woman only to tell her
afterwards, even if he should tell her nothing, Lídia would play
a part in his life in any case. Certain things don't happen
without some consequence, she thought looking at him. Let him
escape — he will never be free... Once, as she was falling, he
caught her, smoothed her hair with a distracted gesture. She
thanked him, giving his arm a gentle squeeze. They smiled into
each other's eyes and suddenly felt themselves overcome by
sheer bliss. They began walking more quickly, wide-eyed and in
a daze.
Perhaps he no longer remembered that moment. She was the
one who remembered such things. The fact is that those
moments were so special that one couldn't recall them when
speaking. Not even when thinking with words. Only by pausing
for a moment and savouring them once more. He might
forget. In her soul, however, there would certainly remain a
mark, clear and rose-coloured, engraving the sensation and that
afternoon. As for her — each day that dawned brought her in
its waters more memories on which to nourish herself. And
little by little, the certainty of happiness, of having achieved her
goal, slowly surfaced inside her body, leaving her satisfied, close
to saturation, close to anguish. When she saw Otávio again, she
now looked at him almost with indifference, finding him inferior
to what he had given her. She wanted to confide her
happiness. But she was somehow afraid of hurting him, as if
she were confessing that she had betrayed him with another
man. Or as if she wanted to flaunt her happiness — before
this man who divided himself between two homes and two
women — to show him that her happiness was greater than
his.
Yes, she thought remotely, staring at him — there are
indestructible things that accompany the body until death as if
they had been born together. And one of those things is what
has been created between a man and a woman who have
shared certain moments.
And when her son was born — she stroked her belly which
was already filling out — the three of them would form a little
family. That was what she wanted. As a happy ending to her
whole history. She and Otávio had been brought up together,
by their mutual cousin. She had lived close to Otávio. No one
had passed through her life except him. In him she had
discovered man, before knowing anything about men and
women. Without giving it much thought, she had vaguely
assembled the male species in Otávio. She had shared his life
to such an extent that she had never sensed the presence of
others except as closed worlds that were alien and superficial.
Always, at every stage, close to him. Even during that phase
when she had become astute, hiding as much as she could,
even when there was nothing to hide. Also during that phase
when people stared at her on the street, and her chums
accepted her, admiring her lovely, thick hair. Otávio pursuing
her with his eyes... that certainty, never more to be effaced,
that she was someone. That was when she became aware that
she was not poor, that she had something to give to Otávio,
that there was a way of surrendering her life to him,
everything that she had been... She had waited for him. When
she had caught up with him, Joana had appeared and he had
fled. She went on waiting. He had returned. A child would be
born. Yes, but before that birth took place, she would demand
her rights. 'To demand her rights' struck her as being a
phrase that had been dormant forever inside her, waiting.
Waiting until she found the strength. She wanted that child to
bud between its parents. And at the heart of all this, she
wanted for herself 'the little family'.
She smiled weakly, listening to Otávio holding forth on some
topic of which she had lost the thread. Ever since the foetus
had started to form inside her, she had lost certain quirks and
developed others, she dared to press ahead with certain
thoughts. It seemed to her that until that moment she had
spent her life telling lies. Her movements were independent
from her body, as if there was now more space in the world
for her existence. She had to look after the child and Otávio,
now if there was... She leaned back more comfortably in the
armchair, her embroidery slipped on to the carpet. She
half-closed her eyes and her womb expanded, sated and
glowing. She relished this sense of well-being, this feeling of
lethargy which now frequently came over her. She hadn't
experienced the slightest nausea, not even at the beginning.
And she was confident that the birth would be easy, as easy
as anything. She ran her hand over her hips which hadn't lost
their shape so far. Somehow, she rather despised other
women.
Otávio caught a glimpse of her expression and felt alarmed.
Dispassionate cruelty... He studied her expression without being
able to decipher it, aware only that he was excluded from that
hovering smile. For it was a smile, a horrible smile, satisfied,
despite the fact that she kept her face straight, her eyes open,
looking straight ahead. He was gripped by terror, he almost
shouted:
— You haven't even been listening!
Lídia sat up with a start, once more his, once more
submissive:
— I...
— You haven't even understood what I was saying, he
repeated staring at her, breathing with difficulty. Would there be
a repetition of the scene that took place that time. No, there
was a child inside her. Why should I have a child? Why me?
Me of all people? It's strange... She would ask herself in the
next breath: What am I doing after all? No, no...
— Not only do I understand you, she said in haste, I love you.
He sighed imperceptibly, still somewhat alarmed by her bid for
freedom. The truth is that she had never entirely come back
to him, as before her pregnancy. And he himself had given
her this kingdom, fool that he was... Yes, but once she had
freed herself from the child, once she had freed herself from
the child... A few minutes later, his calm restored, Otávio gave
in to the lethargy and weakness which so admirably sustained
his relationship with Lídia.
 
Otávio's Encounter
The dark, murky night was cut in half, separated into two
sombre blocks of sleep. Where was she? Between the two
halves, seeing them — the half she had already slept and the
half she still had to sleep — isolated in the timeless and in the
spaceless, in an empty gap. That interval would be discounted
from the years of life.
The ceiling and the walls joined up without any edges, silent,
with folded arms, and she found herself inside a cocoon. Joana
looked at it without thinking, without feeling, one thing looking
at another. Little by little, just by moving her leg, awareness
loomed in the distance, mingled with a taste of sleep in her
mouth, spreading, then pervading her entire body. The
moonlight sent a pale glow over the room, the bed. One
moment, one more moment, one more moment, one more
moment. Suddenly, like a tiny ray, something lit up inside her,
said rapidly without moving a single facial muscle: Look
sideways. She continued to stare at the ceiling without the
slightest interest, but her heart was beating furiously. Look
sideways. She could see that she would end up looking, had a
vague idea of what was there at her side, but she behaved as
if she had no intention of looking, as if she were ignoring the
rest of the bed. Look sideways. Then defeated, before that
multitude of faces watching the scene from up there on the
stage, she slowly turned her head on the pillow and looked.
There was a man there. She realized that this was precisely
what she had been expecting.
His chest was bare, his arms extended, crucified. She turned
her head away again. Well, now I've looked. But almost
immediately she raised her body and resting on one elbow she
stared at him, perhaps without curiosity, but demanding, waiting
for a reply. Or mindful that those impassive faces were waiting
for that gesture. There was a man there. Who was he? The
question surfaced quietly, was already lost, swept away like an
unfortunate leaf by the dark waves. But before Joana could
altogether forget the question, she saw it become more urgent,
pose itself with renewed insistence, its voice whispering in her
ear: who was he?
She grew impatient, weary of that multitude of faces which was
no longer a game she could control, but now making demands,
now making demands. Who was he? A man, a male, she
replied. But that stranger was her man. She looked into his
face, the languid face of a sleeping child. The lips slightly
parted. The pupils, under those thick, lowered eyelids, turned
inwards, dead. She touched him gently on the shoulder and
before getting any reaction, she drew back instantly, terrified.
She paused for a moment, listening to her own heart beating
in her breast. She adjusted her nightdress, giving herself time
to withdraw should she still want to. However she carried on.
She brought her pale arm close to the naked arm of that
human being and, although she had already foreseen the
thought that followed, she trembled, struck by the glaring
difference in colour, as firm and audacious as a scream. There
were two bodies outlined on the bed. And this time she
couldn't complain of having led herself unknowingly to tragedy:
the thought had imposed itself without her having chosen it.
And suppose he were to wake up and find her leaning over
him? If he should suddenly open his eyes, they would meet
hers, two lights crossing with another two lights... She withdrew
rapidly, cowered within herself, overcome with fear, that
unconfessed dread of former nights without rain, in the dark
without sleep. How often must I experience the same things in
different situations? She imagined those eyes as two copper
discs, shining without expression. What voice might come from
that slumbering throat? Sounds like thick arrows, quietly
embedding themselves in the furniture, in the walls, in her. And
once again, all with folded arms, staring into remote space.
Implacably. The chimes of the clock only finish when they
finish, there is nothing to be done. Or one throws a stone at
it, and the noise of broken glass and springs is followed by
silence spreading within like blood. Why not kill the man?
Nonsense, that thought was completely fabricated. She looked at
him. Afraid that all 'that', like pressing a button — you only
had to touch it — would start working noisily, mechanically,
filling the room with live movements and sounds. She was
afraid of her own fear, which left her isolated. She could see
herself from afar, from the top of the extinguished lamp, lost
and puny, covered with moonbeams, beside the man who
might come to life at any moment.
And suddenly, disloyally, she experienced real fear, as live as
any living thing. The mystery lurking in that animal who was
hers, in that man whom she had only known how to love!
Fear in her body, fear in her blood! Perhaps he might strangle
her, kill her... Why not? — she was frightened — the audacity
with which her own thoughts rushed on, guiding her like a tiny
beam, mobile and tremulous, through the dark. Where was she
heading? But why should Otávio not strangle her? Were they
not alone? And suppose he were mad beneath his sleep? —
She trembled. Her legs moved involuntarily, she drew back the
sheets, ready to defend herself, to escape... Ah, if she were to
cry out she would not be afraid, fear would vanish with the
scream... Otávio responded to her movements, raising his
eyebrows in turn, compressing his lips, parting them once more
and going on being dead! She watched him, watched him...
and waited...
There was still silence, the same silence. Perhaps,   who   knows,  
she   might  have  experienced moments of dreaming merged with
reality, she thought to herself. She tried to remember how the
day had passed. Nothing of any importance, except Otávio's
note letting her know that he would be lunching out, something
he had been doing almost regularly for quite some time now.
Or had her fear been more than hallucination? The room was
now bright and cold. She rested with her eyes closed. Happily,
there were few nights when she had nightmares.
How foolish she had been. She brought her hand close, tried
to touch him. She placed her outstretched palm on his chest,
gently to begin with, almost wavering, but gradually overcoming
her fear. Then growing more confident with every minute that
passed, she abandoned herself completely over that broad field
sparsely covered with vegetation. Her eyes wide open, yet
seeing nothing, all her attention focused on herself and on
what she was feeling.
Some furniture creaked, the shadows fastened more firmly on
to the wardrobe.
Then an idea occurred to her. An idea so passionate that her
heart accompanied it at a furious tempo. Like this: she drew
near to him, gently nestled her head in his arm, close to his
chest. She remained still, waiting. Little by little, she could feel
the stranger's warmth on the nape of her neck. She could
hear the rhythmic beating of a heart, remote and earnest. She
examined herself attentively. That living creature was hers. That
unknown man, that other world was hers. She saw him from
afar, from the top of the lamp, his naked body — lost and
weak. Weak. How fragile and delicate those exposed lines were,
unprotected. He, he, the man. From some hidden source,
anguish travelled up through her body, filling all her cells,
pushing her defenceless to the foot of the bed. My God, my
God. Afterwards, in painful childbirth beneath that laboured
breathing, she could feel the comforting oil of renunciation
spilling inside her, at last, at last. He was hers.
She wanted to call him, to plead his support, to beg him to
speak words of appeasement. But she had no desire to
awaken him. She feared that he might not know how to make
her ascend on to a higher plane of feeling in order to achieve
what was still no more than a sweet embryo. She knew that
even at this very moment she was alone, that the man would
awaken in some remote place. That he would be able to
intercept her with some obstacle — a distracted and indifferent
word — on the narrow and luminous path where she was
taking her first tottering steps. Meanwhile, to imagine that he
ignored what was happening inside her did not lessen her
affection. It redoubled it, made it greater than her body and
soul as if to compensate for the man's remoteness.
Joana smiled, but she could not avoid the suffering that began
to throb throughout her entire body like some bitter thirst.
More than suffering, a craving for love swelling and
overwhelming her... Caught up in a light, hazy maelstrom, like
sudden vertigo, she became conscious of the world, of her own
life, of the past from beyond her birth, of the future beyond
her body. Yes, lost like a point, a point without dimensions,
once, a thought. She had been born, she would die, the
earth... A fleeting, intense sensation: a blind immersion into a
colour — crimson, tranquil and expansive as a field. The same
violent, instantaneous awareness that sometimes assailed her in
great moments of love, like a drowning man who is seeing for
the last time.
— My... — she began in a low voice.
But all that she might say was not enough. She was living,
living. She watched him. How he slept, how he existed. She
had never been so aware of him before. When she had made
love to him during those first months of their marriage, she
had been fascinated to discover her own body. The renewal
had been hers, she had not given herself rapturously to this
man and had remained isolated. Now suddenly she understood
that love could make one desire the moment that comes in
that impulse which is life... — She could feel the world gently
throbbing in her breast, her body ached as if she were bearing
the femininity of all women.
She fell silent once more, peering into herself. She remem-
bered: I am the tiny wave that has no other region except the
sea, I tussle with myself, I glide, I fly, laughing, giving, sleeping,
but alas, always within myself, always within myself. Since
when? Something I read as a child? Thought? Suddenly she
remembered: she had thought of it just now, perhaps before
placing her arm on that of Otávio, perhaps at that moment
when she had felt like screaming... Everything was increasingly
in the past... And the past was as mysterious as the future...
Yes... and it had also come, as fast as a silent car out of
control, the man she sometimes met in the street... that man
who stared at her, silent, thin and as sharp as a knife. She
had already felt it vaguely that night, leaning on her conscience
like the point of a needle... like a premonition ... but at what
moment? In her dream? During her vigil? A new flux of pain
and life began to swell and inundate her, with the anguish of
being imprisoned.
— I... — she began timidly addressing Otávio.
It was getting darker, she couldn't see him except as a
shadow: he became more and more blurred, slipped through
her hands, lay dead in the depth of her sleep. And she,
solitary as the ticking of a clock in an empty house. She
waited, seated on the bed, wide-eyed, the chill of approaching
dawn penetrating her flimsy nightdress. Alone in the world,
crushed by the excess of life, listening to the blare of music,
much too loud for any human being.
But release came and Joana trembled at its impulse... Because
gentle and sweet as daybreak in a forest, inspiration came..
.Then she invented what she must say. Her eyes closed,
submissive, she uttered in a whisper words born at that
moment, hitherto unheard, still tender from creation — new
and fragile buds. They were less than words, merely
disconnected syllables, meaningless, lukewarm, that flowed and
criss-crossed, fertilized, were reborn in a single being only to
separate immediately, breathing, breathing...
Her eyes moistened with sweet happiness and gratitude. She
had spoken... The words preceding language itself, from its
source, its very source. She went up to him, giving him her
soul, while feeling sated as if she had absorbed the world. She
was like a woman.
The sombre trees in the garden secretly guarded the silence,
she knew, she knew... She fell asleep.
 
Lídia
The following morning was like a first day all over again, Joana
felt.
Otávio had gone early and she had blessed him for it as if he
had intentionally given her time to think, to observe herself.
She didn't wish to rush into any decision, she felt that any of
her movements could make her precious and dangerous.
They had been seconds, nothing but fleeting moments. For she
received Lídia's letter inviting her to call.
Reading those words had made Joana smile even before
provoking these rapid, heavy heartbeats. And also the cold,
steel blade resting against the warmth inside her body. As if
her deceased aunt had come back to life and were speaking to
her, Joana imagined the old woman's alarm, felt those open
eyes — or were they her own eyes that she denied any
surprises? Had Otávio returned to Lídia, despite Joana? -her
aunt would say.
Joana ran her fingers through her hair, absorbed the cold
blade resting against her warm heart, she smiled once more,
oh, simply to gain time. But of course, why not continue with
Lídia — she answered her dead aunt. This lucid thought
caused the icy blade to press on her lungs, mocking her. Why
refuse to accept events? To possess many things at the same
time, to feel in various ways, to recognize life from different
sources... Who could prevent someone from living expansively?
Afterwards she plunged into an odd state of mild excitement.
She wandered aimlessly through the house, she even wept a
little, without much suffering, just for the sake of weeping —
she persuaded herself- nothing more, just like someone waving
their hand, like someone looking. Am I suffering? — she
sometimes asked herself and once more the one who was
thinking filled her with surprise, curiosity and pride and there
was no room left for the other to suffer. But this subtle
exaltation did not permit her to continue on the same plane
for very long. She passed at once to another tone of
behaviour, she played a little piano music, forgot Lídia's letter.
When she remembered her, vaguely, a bird flying to and fro,
she couldn't decide whether to be sad or happy, calm or
anxious. She kept thinking of the previous night, of the tall
window pane shining serenely in the moonlight, of Otávio's bare
chest, of Joana who had fallen into a deep sleep. Almost for
the first time in her life, entrusting herself to the man who lay
asleep at her side. In fact, she had not distanced herself from
the Joana full of affection from the night before. Ashamed,
humble and rejected, the latter had wandered until returning
and Joana was increasingly more cruel, more absorbed and
closer to herself — she thought. So much the better. Except
that the cold steel was constantly being renewed, never became
warm. Especially at the core of any thought there hovered yet
another, perplexed, almost bewitched, as on the day her father
died: things happened without her inventing them...
In the afternoon she could at last observe Lídia and she
realized that she was as remote from her as from the woman
with the voice. They looked at each other and could not bring
themselves to hate or even spurn each other. Lídia had raised,
pale and discreet, various topics of no interest to either of
them. Her nascent pregnancy floated throughout the entire
room, saturated her and penetrated Joana. Even those sombre
pieces of furniture with their crocheted mats, appeared to be
protected by the same secret soon to be revealed, by the same
waiting for a child. Lídia's eyes were wide open and
shadowless. Such a beautiful woman. Her lips full but impassive,
without the slightest tremor, the lips of someone who is not
afraid of pleasure, who receives it without remorse. What
poetry supported her existence? What was that murmuring
trying to say which she could divine inside Lídia? The woman
with the voice multiplied into countless women... But where was
their divinity to be found? Even in the most vulnerable of
those women there lurked the shadow of that knowledge you
don't acquire through intelligence. The intelligence of blind
things. The force of the stone which, on falling, pushes another
which will finally drop into the sea and kill a fish. Sometimes
the same strength could be found in women who were only
superficially mothers and wives, the timid mistresses of men,
like her aunt, like Armanda. Meanwhile that strength, that unity
in weakness... Oh, perhaps she was exaggerating, perhaps the
divinity of women was not specific, it was only in the fact that
they existed. Yes, yes, there was the truth: they existed more
than men, they were the symbol of the thing in the thing itself.
And woman was the mystery in itself, she discovered. There
was to be found in all women a quality of primary matter,
something that might define itself but never came to be
realized, for its very essence was that of 'becoming'. For was it
not precisely through that essence that the past united itself to
the future and to all time? Lídia and Joana remained silent for
one drawn-out moment. They didn't exactly feel themselves
united, but without any need of words, as if they had really
come together simply to look at each other and then go away.
The strangeness of their situation became clearer when the two
women felt that they were not fighting. In both there was a
gesture of impatience, both still had a duty to perform. Joana
pushed it aside, suddenly satisfied:
— Well — the tone of her voice roused her abruptly — I think
our meeting is over.
Lídia was astonished. But how? If they hadn't as much as said
anything! Most of all, she loathed the idea of something
unfinished:
— We haven't said anything yet... And we must have a chat..
.Joana smiled. In that smile I begin to act out weariness — not
with any force — but exactly as I should in order to impress
her. What are these foolish thoughts?
— Don't you think — Joana asked — that we're straying from
the subject that brought us together? If we discussed it, at
least it would now be without interest or passion... Let's leave
everything for another day.
For an instant the image of the man struck them as being
blurred and importune. But Lídia knew that the moment that
woman disappeared, the apathy and torpor to which she had
reduced her, leaving her powerless to move, would also vanish.
And once roused, she would want the child. The little family.
She made an effort to emerge from that drowsiness, to open
her eyes and put up a fight.
— It's silly to lose the opportunity...
Yes, let's buy the article, let's buy the article. I feel exhausted
after all that work preparing for the party. Joana burst out
laughing again, a laughter void of any happiness.
— I know that I can expect nothing from you, the pregnant
woman suddenly resumed forcefully — a cloud uncovering the
sun, everything shining brightly once more and brimming with
life. Joana also brightened, could feel the cloud uncovering the
sun, everything bubbling gently hand-in-hand in a leisurely
ring-a-ring o'roses, like that played by children.
But suddenly the girl pushed herself and her pregnancy in one
last effort to wake up:
— I know you, I know just how evil you are.
Now the room was coming back to life.
— Ah, you know?
Yes, it was coming back to life, it roused Joana. What am I
saying? How dare I come here? I am far away, far away. You
only need to look at that woman to realize that she couldn't
possibly like me. The steel suddenly rested on her heart. Ah,
the jealousy, that was jealousy, that cold hand kneading her
slowly, squeezing her, shrinking her soul. With me, the following
happens or else threatens to happen: from one moment to the
next, by moving in a certain manner, I can transform myself
into a thin line. Just like that! into a streak of light, so that the
person is just at my side, unable to surprise me or my
imperfections. Meanwhile Lídia has various planes. With every
gesture another aspect of her dimension is revealed. At her
side no one slips or is lost for they can find support on her
breasts — solemn, restful and pale, while mine are futile — or
on her belly where there is even room for a child. I mustn't
exaggerate her importance, for a child may be born in the
womb of all women. She is so beautiful and a woman.
Tranquil, primary matter, despite all other women. What's in
the air? I'm alone. Those full lips Lídia possesses, so sensuous
and clearly outlined with bright lipstick, while the one I use is
dark, invariably scarlet, scarlet, scarlet, the face white and thin.
Those brown eyes of hers, enormous and steady, perhaps they
have nothing to offer, but they receive so much that no one
could resist them, least of all Otávio. I am a feathered creature.
Lídia is covered in hair and Otávio is lost between us,
defenceless. How can he escape from my brilliance and from
promise of flight or from the self-assurance of that woman?
We two women could form an alliance and provide for
humanity, we could leave early each morning and go from
door to door ringing the bell: Which does madam prefer: mine
or hers? and we would deliver a child. I can see why Otávio
didn't separate from Lídia: he is always ready to throw himself
at the feet of those who walk ahead. He cannot look at a
mountain without being impressed by its solidity, he cannot
look at a woman with an ample bosom without wanting to rest
his head there. How impoverished I am alongside her, so
confident and self-possessed. Or I light up and become
magnificent, instantly magnificent, or I become obscure, and
swathe myself in drapes. Lídia, whatever may be said of her,
never changes, always has the same clear foundations. My
hands and hers. Mine — outlined, solitary, roughly sketched
back and front, with careless haste by a brush soaked in an
insipid white; I'm forever raising my hand to my forehead,
forever threatening to leave it suspended in mid-air, oh how
futile I am, only now do I see it. Lídia's hands — are clearly
defined, attractive, covered by pliant skin, pinkish, yellowish, like
a flower I once saw somewhere, hands that rest on things, full
of authority and wisdom. My whole being swims and floats, I
cross what exists with my nerves, I am nothing if not desire,
wrath, vagueness, as impalpable as energy. Energy? but where
is my strength? in vagueness, in vagueness... And investing it
with life, not the reality, but merely the vague impulse forward.
I want to astonish Lídia, to turn the conversation into
something strange, subtle, evasive, but no, but yes, no, but why
not? She suddenly remembered Otávio, stirring and blowing his
cup of coffee in order to cool it, his expression serious,
interested and ingenuous. To surprise Lídia, yes, to draw her...
Like that time at boarding school, when she suddenly felt the
need to test her influence, to feel the admiration of her
school-mates with whom she generally had little contact. Then
she would coldly put on an act, inventing, resplendent as if
wreaking vengeance. She emerged from the concealment of
silence to engage in battle:
— Look at that man... He drinks his coffee with milk in the
morning, very slowly dunking his bread in the cup, allowing it
to drip, munching it, then getting to his feet, heavy and sad...
Her school-mates looked, they saw some man or other, and
yet, despite their being surprised and intentionally distant to
begin with, and yet... it was miraculously correct! They did
begin to see the man get up from the table... his cup empty...
some flies.. .Joana continued to gain time, to advance, her eyes
glowing:
— And that other... At night he pulls off his shoes with a
struggle, tosses them into the distance, sighs, and mutters to
himself: What matters is not to lose heart, what matters is not
to lose heart...
The more impressionable girls whispered, already smiling, won
over: It's true... how do you know! The others held back. But
they ended up surrounding Joana, waiting for her to show
them something else. Her gestures at this point became agile,
feverish, and as she became more and more inspired, she
affected all of them:
— Look at that woman's eyes... round, transparent, they
tremble and tremble, any minute now they could dissolve into
a drop of water...
— And what about that expression? — sometimes Joana
became more daring when she discovered a sudden shyness in
those girls who read certain books in the school corridor. And
what about that expression? of someone seeking pleasure
wherever it may be found...
Her school-mates laughed, but little by little something
disquieting, painful and awkward crept into that scene. They
ended up laughing much too loudly, nervous and dissatisfied.
Joana, in high spirits, excelled herself, held the girls captive to
her will and word, imbued with an ardent and cutting wit like
the glancing strokes of a whip. Until, hemmed in at last, they
breathed her brilliant and suffocating air. Suddenly feeling
satisfied, Joana then stopped, her eyes dry, and her body
shaking in triumph. Defenceless, sensing Joana's hasty
departure and her contempt, the girls also withered away, as if
ashamed. One of them said, before they dispersed, bored with
each other's company:
— Joana is unbearable when she's happy...
Lídia blushed. The 'Ah, you know?' of Joana had sounded so
curt, distracted and odd, so remote from Lídia's emotion.
— It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter — Joana tried to pacify
her. So you're going to have a baby... she went on. You want
Otávio, the father. It's understandable. Why don't you get a job
to support the brat? No doubt, you were expecting greater
kindness on my part, despite what I've just told you about my
wickedness. But frankly, kindness makes me want to throw up.
Why don't you find yourself a job? Then you wouldn't need
Otávio. I'm not prepared to give you just everything. But first
tell me about your romance with Otávio, tell me how you
managed to get him to come back to you. Or better still: what
he thinks of me. Don't be afraid to tell me. Am I making him
very unhappy?
— I don't know, we never mention your name.
So I was alone then? and this joy of suffering, the steel
crinkling my skin, that chilling cold which is jealousy, no that
chilling cold which is so: Oh, you walked all that way? then
you must go back. But this time I shall not make a fresh start,
I swear, I shall rebuild nothing, I shall remain behind like a
stone there in the remote distance, at the beginning of the
road. There is something that goes round with me, it goes
round and round, it makes me dizzy, it makes me dizzy, and
calmly deposits me in the same place.
She turned to the pregnant woman:
— It just isn't possible. .. He wouldn't free himself so readily.
— But in a certain way he loathes you! — Lídia had shouted.
— Ah, is that so?
— Do you also feel the same? — Joana had asked. — Of
course, of course... It's not only hatred, despite everything. —
Last night, my affection, it isn't important, deep down I knew I
was alone, at least I wasn't deceived, for I knew, I knew. —
And suppose it was also fear?
— Fear? I don't understand, Lídia expressed surprise, fear of
what!
— Perhaps because I'm unhappy, fear of getting close. Perhaps
that's it: fear of also having to suffer...
— Are you unhappy? — the other had probed in a whisper.
— But don't be frightened, unhappiness has nothing to do with
wickedness, Joana had laughed. — What happened in the end?
I'm not present, I'm not present, what happened, weariness, a
desire to leave in tears. I know, I know; I should like to spend
at least a day watching Lídia go back and forth from the
kitchen to the sitting-room, then have lunch with her in a quiet
room — a few flies, the tinkling of cutlery — where no heat
might penetrate, wearing an old baggy dressing- gown in a
bold floral pattern. Later in the afternoon, sitting beside her
and looking on as she sewed, giving her a little assistance here
and there, the scissors, the thread, waiting until it was time for
her bath and a cup of tea, it would be nice, leisurely and
refreshing. Was this perhaps what had always been missing in
my life? Why is she so powerful? I can't imagine that because
I haven't spent my afternoons sewing, that this makes me
inferior to her. Or does it? It does, it doesn't, it does, it
doesn't. I know what I want: a woman who is ugly but
wholesome with large breasts, who might say to me: what is all
this about inventing things? I won't stand for any nonsense,
come here at once! — A woman who will give me a warm
bath, dress me in a white linen night-dress, braid my hair and
put me to bed, thoroughly annoyed and muttering: Whatever
next? You run around, eating at any old hour, you'll catch
some illness if you're not careful, making up dramas, do you
think that makes you important, drink up this bowl of hot
broth. She raises my head with one hand, covers me with a
large sheet, draws back some straggling hairs from my
forehead, now clean and fresh, and says before I sink into the
warmth of sleep: You'll see how that face will soon fill out,
forget all these foolish ideas and be a good girl. Someone who
will rescue me as if I were a poor stray, who will open their
door to me, brush me, feed me, simply love me as if I were a
dog, that's all I ask, as if I were a dog, as if I were a child.
— Would you like to be married — really married — to him?
— Joana questioned her.
Lídia had given her a sharp look, anxious to discover if the
question was meant to be sarcastic.
— Yes, I would.
— Why? —Joana asked in surprise. Can't you see that you
wouldn't gain anything from such a marriage? Everything
marriage has to offer you already have — Lídia blushed, but I
wasn't being malicious, an ugly but wholesome woman.
— I'll bet you've spent your whole life wanting to get married.
Lídia felt an urge to rebel: she had been touched to the quick,
in the coldest possible manner.
— Yes. Every woman... — she agreed.
— You're getting at me. For I never thought of getting
married. The funny thing is that I still feel certain I didn't
marry... This is more or less how I saw it: marriage is a goal,
after I get married nothing more can happen to me. Just
imagine: to have someone always at your side, never to know
loneliness. — My God! — never to be by yourself, never,
never. And to be a married woman, in other words, someone
with her destiny traced out. From then onwards you simply
have to wait for death. I thought: you couldn't even preserve
the freedom to be unhappy because you drag another person
along with you. There is someone constantly watching you,
observing you, accompanying every move you make. And even
boredom with life has a certain beauty — I thought — when
you suffer it alone in quiet despair. But with two, eating the
same tasteless bread day after day, seeing your own frustration
mirrored in your partner's habits, the burden of the bed you
share, of your life in common, plotting and threatening you
with a common death. I always said: never.
— Why did you get married? — Lídia asked.
— I don't know. All I know is that this 'I don't know' is not
just my being ignorant about things. It is the very heart of the
matter. I'm evading the question, any minute now she'll look at
me in that way I know so well. I certainly got married because
I wanted to marry. Because Otávio wanted to marry me. That's
it, that's it, I've got it: instead of asking to live with me without
getting married, he suggested something else. Besides it came
to the same thing. And I was foolish, Otávio's good-looking,
don't you agree?
I couldn't recall anything else. — Pause — How do you love
him: with your body?
— Yes, with my body -Lídia had mumbled.
— It's love.
— And you? Lídia ventured.
— Not quite.
— But he told me, on the contrary...
Lídia had broken off. She studied her carefully. How ingenuous
Joana seemed. She spoke of love in such a clear and
straightforward manner for it was certain that nothing had
been revealed to her so far through love. She had not
succumbed to its shadows, she had not yet felt its deep and
secret transformations. Otherwise she would be, like her, almost
ashamed of so much happiness, she would remain vigilant at
its door, protecting from the cold light what mustn't be blighted
if it is to go on living. Meanwhile there was Joana's vivacity...
what she had understood through Otávio... that life existed
inside her... But Lídia suspected that Joana's love didn't even
protect Joana herself. Without experience, intact, unblemished,
she could have been mistaken for a virgin. Lídia looked at her
and tried to explain to herself what was hovering and lucid on
that face. Love certainly did not bind her, even to love. While
Lídia herself, almost instantly after the first kiss, had been
transformed into woman.
— Yes, yes, but nothing changes, Joana continued tranquilly. I
also love him more dispassionately, both as a human being and
as a man. — Is she about to look at me in that timid way,
scared and deferential: oh, why do you discuss such difficult
things, why do you raise such enormous issues at such a
simple moment? Spare me, spare me. But this time I'm to
blame because frankly, I don't know what I was trying to say.
Nevertheless, this is how I shall outdo her.
Lídia hesitated.
— Isn't that more than love?
— Perhaps, Joana said, surprised. What matters is that it's no
longer love. — And suddenly, I'm overcome with weariness, the
great 'what's the use' swamps me, and I know that I'm about
to say something. — Keep Otávio. Have his child, be happy,
and leave me in peace.
— Do you know what you're saying? — the other had
shouted.
— Of course I know.
— Don't you like him?...
— I like him. But I've never known what to do with the
persons or things I like. Ever since childhood, there comes a
point when I find them a burden. Perhaps if I truly loved with
my body... Perhaps I should become more tied... -I'm confiding
in her, dear God. I'm now going to put it like this: — Otávio
is escaping from me because I don't bring peace to anyone, I
always end up giving everyone the same treatment. I force
them into admitting: I was blind, it wasn't peace I had, but
that's what I want now.
— Even so... I believe — no one can complain... Not even
Otávio... I suppose not even I... — Lídia had not known how
to explain, she had remained uncertain, her hands didn't rest
on things.
— What?
— I don't know. — She looked at Joana and searched for
something on her face, intrigued, moving her head.
— What? — Joana repeated.
— I don't understand. Joana almost blushed.
— I too. I've never penetrated my own heart. Something had
been said.
Joana walked up to the window, looked into the garden where
Lídia's child would play, the child that was now in Lídia's
womb, the child that would be nourished by Lídia's breasts,
that would be Lídia. Or Otávio, unripe fruit? No Lídia, the one
who is transmitting herself. Were they to cut her through the
middle — the sound of fresh leaves splitting — she would open
up like a pomegranate, wholesome and pink, as transparent as
bright eyes. The base of her life was as gentle as a stream
flowing through a meadow. And in that meadow she herself
moved, confident and serene as an animal grazing. She
compared her with Otávio, for whom life would never be more
than a little private adventure. And with herself, using other
people as a sombre background against which her figure stood
out, resplendent and imposing. Lídia's verses: Silence alone is
my prayer, oh Lord, and I can say no more; I am so happy
feeling that I silence myself to feel even more; it was in silence
that a spider's subtle and fragile web formed inside me: this
sweet ignorance of life which allows me to live. Or was
everything a lie? Oh, God, the more she needed to act, the
more she lost herself in foolish thoughts. Everything was almost
certainly a lie, it was even possible that Lídia was much less
innocent than she imagined. But even so, she was afraid to
remain near her, to look at her reluctantly with a little effort,
to make her conscious of herself. To preserve her, without
changing her colouring or her precious voice.
— He told me that story about the little old man... you threw
the book at him, such an old man... Before I understood, but
now I don't know how you were able... — Lídia had asked.
But it was true.
Lídia looked at her, her lips parted, waiting for her answer.
And suddenly she could see quite clearly that she had no wish
to struggle against that woman. She shook her bewildered
head. Her face melted, trembled, its features wavered in search
of some expression:
— I didn't do that intentionally, you know? No, I didn't do...
Lídia went on anxiously, her face punctured by rapid tremors...
Why should I want to deceive you? No, no, that's not what I
mean to say, it isn't that...
And unexpectedly, taking Joana unawares, she burst into tears
and cried her heart out. She's about to have a child, she's
nervous, Joana thought. The other humiliated herself wearily:
— It wouldn't bother me to steal Otávio from another woman.
But I didn't know that there was you... Not just anyone like
me, but someone so...so good... so sublime...
Joana was taken aback. Ah, I was striving for this: I
succeeded in being sublime... as in days gone by... No, no, it
isn't quite like this, I didn't force the situation, how could I,
with the steel scoring and chilling my flesh? Don't put me
under that light, with the wrinkles on my forehead so obvious.
I must find that degree of light and shade in which I suddenly
become fleshy, my lipstick darkening like an ingrained
bloodstain, my face white as chalk beneath my hair... Once
more they are pressing the steel blade against my heart. When
I leave, she will despise me precisely at the moment when she
is dazzled. I am instantly wonderful... God, God...I set off
running, hallucinating, my body flying, hesitating... where to?
There is a startled, light substance in the air which I have
managed to secure, it's like the second that precedes the crying
of an infant. That night, I don't know when, there were
stairways, fluttering fans, soft lights swaying their gentle rays like
the nodding heads of indulgent mothers, there was a man
watching me from that line beyond the horizon, I was a
stranger, but I triumphed somehow, even if it meant despising
something. Everything glided smoothly, in quiet harmony. It was
almost coming to an end — the end of what? of that noble,
languid staircase, bowing, waving its long, gleaming arm, its
magnificent and proud handrail, night coming to an end — as
I slipped to the centre of the room, light as a bubble of air.
And suddenly, loud as a clap of thunder, yet as mute as silent
fear, and, suddenly one more step and I couldn't go on! The
hem of my organza dress shuddered into an ugly grimace,
struggled, writhed, tore on the sharp edge of a piece of
furniture and there it remained trembling, gasping, perplexed
beneath my look of amazement. And suddenly things had
hardened, an orchestra had exploded into tortuous harmonies
and fallen silent immediately, there was something victorious
and tragic in the air. I discovered that deep down I held no
surprises: that everything was slowly heading towards that
mystery which had now precipitated on to its true plane. I
wanted to escape at once, weeping over my wretched dress
without its hem, torn and disconsolate. The lights now shone
with intensity and pride, the fans exposed radiant, mocking
faces, there from beyond the horizon the man was laughing in
my direction, the banisters recoiled, and closed their eyes. No
one needed to tell any more lies now that I already knew
everything! Once again, I shall throw myself headlong into
another state. Why? Why? I'm getting out of here, I'm going
home, from one minute to the next the tear in my dress, to
hear the poignant strains of the orchestra followed by sudden
silence, all the musicians lying dead on the platform, in that
great hall, frenzied and empty. I must look straight ahead at
the tear, but I've always been afraid of exploding with pain like
the strains of the orchestra. No one suspects just how far I
can reach, almost in triumph, as if I were some creation: it's
that feeling of super-human power achieved with a certain
degree of suffering. But the next minute you cannot tell if it's a
feeling of power or of absolute impotency, just like wishing with
one's body and brain to move a finger and simply not
succeeding. It isn't simply not succeeding: but all things
laughing and weeping at the same time. No, I certainly didn't
invent this situation, and that is what I find most surprising.
For my craving for experience couldn't explain that cold metal
resting on my warm flesh, warmed at last by the affection of
yesterday. Oh, don't make a martyr of yourself: you know that
you couldn't continue in the same state for very long: once
more you would open and close circles of life, throwing them
aside, withered... That moment, too, would pass, even if Lídia
should not reclaim Otávio, even if I were never to know that
Otávio had not abandoned her, although married to me. Am I
not perhaps mixing a certain happiness, sweet and ironic, with
that threat of suffering? Am I not perhaps loving myself at this
moment? Only when I leave this place shall I permit myself to
look at the tear on my dress. Nothing has happened except
that yesterday I had begun my renewal and now I am
withdrawing because that woman is nervous, she's expecting
Otávio's child. Especially since there has been no essential
transformation, all this already existed, there was simply the
tear in the dress, revealing certain things. And truly, truly, truly
throbbing headache, weariness, truly everything was heading this
way.
— I, too, could have a child, she said aloud. Her voice
sounded clear and pleasing.
— Yes — Lídia had murmured in amazement.
— I, too, could have a child. Why not!
— No...
— No? But yes... I could give Otávio a child, not now, but
whenever it suited me. I could have a child and then give you
back Otávio.
— But this is monstrous! — Lídia had screamed.
— But why? Is it monstrous to keep two women? You know
damn well it isn't. I suppose it feels good to be pregnant. But
is it enough for someone to be expecting a child or is that still
too little?
— It's a nice feeling, Lídia had said wearily, her eyes open.
— So?
— You also feel nervous about childbirth at times, the other
replied mechanically.
— Don't be frightened, there isn't an animal that doesn't breed.
You'll have an easy delivery and so shall I. We've both been
blessed with a broad pelvis.
— Yes...
— I also want everything life has to offer. Why not? Do you
think I'm sterile? Not one little bit. I haven't had any children
because I didn't want them.
I can feel myself holding a child, Joana thought. Sleep, my
baby, sleep, I tell it. The child is warm and I am melancholy.
But it's the melancholy of happiness, that peace and
reassurance that leaves you looking calm and unperturbed. And
when my child touches me he doesn't rob my thoughts like
others. But after I've given him milk from these delicate and
attractive breasts, my child will thrive on my strength and
crush me with his life. He will distance himself from me and I
shall become his useless old mother. I won't feel cheated. But
simply defeated and I shall say: I know nothing, I'm capable of
conceiving a child yet I know nothing. God will accept my
humility and say: I was capable of conceiving the world and I
know nothing. I shall feel closer to Him and the woman with
the voice. My child will stir in my arms and I shall tell myself:
Joana, Joana, this is good. I shall utter no other word for
truth will bring comfort to my arms.
 
The Man
Between one instant and the next, between the past and the
future, the white uncertainty of an interval. Empty as the
distance from one minute to another on the dial of the clock.
The core of events arising silent and dead, a fraction of
eternity.
Perhaps no more than a quiet second separating one stretch
of life from the next. Not even a second, she couldn't calculate
it as time, yet drawn out like an endless straight line. Profound,
coming from afar-a black bird, a dot growing on the horizon,
approaching one's conscience like a ball thrown from the end
to the beginning. And exploding before eyes perplexed in
essence by silence. Leaving behind the perfect interval, without
knowing how to merge it with life. To carry forever that tiny
dot — blind and intact, much too swift to allow itself to be
revealed.
Joana felt it as she walked across Lídia's tiny garden, not
knowing where she was going, only that she was leaving
behind all that had lived. When she closed the little gate, she
was leaving Lídia and Otávio behind, and, once more solitary in
herself, she walked away.
The beginning of a storm had abated and the fresh air
circulated pleasantly. She climbed the hill once more and her
heart was still beating without any rhythm. She sought the
peace of those paths at that hour, between afternoon and
evening, an invisible cicada humming the same melody. The old
damp walls in ruins, invaded by ivy and creepers sensitive to
the wind. She halted and without her footsteps she could hear
the silence stir. Only her own body disturbed that calm. She
imagined it without her presence and divined the freshness
which those dead things must have when mixed with others,
precariously alive as in the beginning of creation.
The tall, shuttered houses, guarded like towers. One of the
mansions was reached by a long drive, sombre and quiet, the
end of the world. Close by, there was a descent, the starting
point of another road, and it became clear that this was not
the end. The mansion was squat and wide, its windows
broken, the shutters drawn and covered in dust. She was
familiar with that garden where soft tufts of grass were
interspersed with crimson roses and old, rusty tins. Under the
flowering shrubs of jasmine she would find faded newspapers,
splinters of damp wood from previous graftings. Amidst the
heavy, old trees, the sparrows and pigeons scratching at the
soil as usual. A little bird interrupted its flight, hopped around
before disappearing into one of the thickets. The mansion
proud and serene in its ruined state. To die there. One could
only reach that house when the end had come. To die in that
damp earth so suitable for receiving corpses. But it wasn't
death she craved. She was also afraid.
A thread of water seeped incessantly through the dark wall.
Joana paused for a moment, looked at it with a vacant,
impassive expression. During one of her strolls she had already
sat beside the rusty little gate, her oval face pressed against the
cold railings, trying to sink into the dank, murky smell of the
yard. That impenetrable quietness, that odour. But this had
been a long time ago. Now she had separated herself from the
past.
She carried on walking. She no longer felt that feverish heat
which had been provoked by her conversation with Lídia. She
was pale and utter exhaustion now left her almost weak, her
features more delicate and refined. Once again she waited for
an end, an end that never came, to complete her moments. If
only something inevitable would descend upon her, she wanted
to give way, to surrender. Sometimes her feet took the wrong
direction, weighed her down, her legs scarcely able to move.
But she forced herself on, saved herself for that fall further
ahead. She looked at the ground, the straw-coloured grasses
which humbly sprang up again after each trampling.
She raised her eyes and saw him. That same man who often
followed her without ever accosting her. She had already seen
him many times along these same roads, during her evening
stroll. She wasn't surprised. She knew that something would
happen somehow. Sharp as a knife, yes, even the night before,
lying beside Otávio, not knowing what would happen the
following day, she had remembered this man. Sharp as a
knife... Almost in a daze, as she tried to catch a glimpse of
him from a distance, she saw him multiplied into innumerable
faces, trembling and formless as they crammed the road. When
her vision cleared, her forehead covered in perspiration, she
saw him by contrast as a poor, solitary dot coming towards
her, lost on that long, deserted road. She felt sure he would
only trail her as on other occasions. But she was tired and
came to a halt.
The man's figure drew nearer and nearer, got bigger and
bigger, and Joana felt herself sink ever more deeply into the
inevitable. She could still withdraw, she could turn tail and go
away, thus avoiding him. Nor would she be escaping, for she
divined the man's humility. There was nothing to keep her
there, immobile, waiting for him to approach. Not even if death
were now to approach, not even villainy, hope or suffering
once again. She had simply come to a halt. The veins were
severed that connected her with living things, assembled into a
distant block, exacting a logical sequel, however outdated and
spent. Only she herself had survived, still breathing. And before
her, a fresh field, the colour of the rising dawn still neutral.
She must penetrate its mists in order to be able to make it
out. She couldn't retreat, she saw no reason for doing so. If
she still hesitated before that stranger who came closer and
closer, it's because she feared the life which implacably
approached once more.
She tried to cling to that interval, to remain suspended there,
in that cold abstract world, without mingling with its blood.
He arrived. He stopped a few paces away from her. They
stood there in silence. She with staring eyes, wide and weary.
He was shaking, nervous and uncertain. All around the leaves
rustled in the breeze, a bird chirped monotonously.
The silence dragged on, waiting for them to recover their
speech. But neither of them could discover in the other some
opening word. They both merged in that silence. Little by little
he stopped shaking, his eyes focused more intently on the
woman's body, they gently took possession of it and its
weariness. He looked at her, oblivious of himself and his
shyness. Joana could sense him penetrating her and offered no
resistance.
When he spoke, she imperceptibly straightened up. She felt as
if she had been there for ages, but when he uttered his
opening words without attempting to start up a conversation
she knew that she had truly distanced herself
incom-mensurably from the beginning.
— I live in that house, he said.
She waited.
— Would you like to rest?
Joana nodded and he watched in silence the luminous aura
traced out by the tousled hairs around her small head. He
walked ahead and she followed him.
When he spoke, she imperceptibly straightened up, he lowered
the blinds and the shadow extended across the floor as far as
the closed door. He pulled up a comfortable, old armchair
which she sank into, drawing in her legs. The man himself sat
on the edge of the narrow bed which was covered with a
crumpled sheet. He remained quite still, his hands joined,
watching her.
Joana closed her eyes. She could hear sounds, muffled and
remote, pervading the house, an infant's cry of mild surprise.
As if from another world, there rang out the vigorous crowing
of a distant cockerel.
Behind everything, water flowing gently, the laboured and
rhythmic breathing of the trees.
An anticipated movement nearby made her open her eyes. She
couldn't see him at first in the semi-darkness of the room. She
began to recognize him little by little kneeling by the side of
the bed, his hands covering his face as it swayed to and fro.
She wanted to call out to him but didn't know how. She was
reluctant to touch him. But the man's anguish began to affect
her more and more, Joana stirred uneasily in the armchair,
waiting for him to look at her.
He lifted his head and Joana was surprised. The man's parted
lips were moist and shiny as if a light were illuminating them
from within. His eyes were bright, it was impossible to say
whether because of sorrow or some strange happiness. His
head was thrown back, he could scarcely keep his balance in
his efforts to get a grip on himself, to stop shaking.
— What is it? — Joana whispered in fascination. He looked at
her.
— I'm afraid, he said finally.
They stared at each other for a second. And she was not
afraid, but she felt a deep happiness, more intense than fear,
possess her and inundate her whole body.
— I shall return to this house, she said.
He confronted her, suddenly terrified, unable to breathe. For a
second she waited for him to shout or invent some mad
gesture which she couldn't even begin to explain. The man's
lips quivered for a second. And scarcely able to rid himself of
Joana's gaze, running from it like someone demented, he
buried his face abruptly in his long, thin hands.
 
Under the Man's Protection
Joana. Joana, the man thought, awaiting her arrival. Joana, a
simple name. Saint Joana, so chaste. How innocent and pure
she was. He saw her childlike features, her eloquent hands like
those of a blind man. She was not pretty, at least never since
manhood had he dreamed of that creature, never awaited her.
Perhaps that is why he had pursued her so often in the road,
without even waiting for her to look, perhaps... He couldn't say,
he had always enjoyed seeing her. She was not pretty. Or
perhaps she was? How could one tell? It was so hard to
decide, as if he had never seen her before or never embraced
her so often. There was a threat of transformation in her
expression, in her movements, from one moment to the next.
Even in repose she was something on the point of raising
itself. And what did he now understand and feel so
miraculously, as if she had explained it to him? — he asked
himself. He closed his eyes, his arms outstretched along the
sides of the bed. But only until he heard the sound of Joana's
footsteps outside. For he had never dared to relax in her
presence. He bent over her, waited upon her every moment,
absorbing her. But he never tired and that attitude didn't make
him any less spontaneous. It simply threw him into another
kind of spontaneity, hitherto unknown. He was now two
different persons, but little by little his new state of being grew
and overshadowed the past of the other. He pursed his lips.
He felt there was some strange logic in having experienced
certain tortures, serene indignities, the careless lack of any
route where he might receive Joana at long last. Not that he
had ever been pushed into the mire against his will, not that
he considered himself a martyr. He had never awaited a
solution. Even with the women whom he guarded, guarded
and abandoned. Even with that woman in whose house he
had now idly installed himself, even though he could scarcely
tolerate her presence, an exhausting and fragile shadow. He
had walked on his own feet, his body conscious, experiencing
and suffering without any affection for himself, coldly and
ingenuously conceding everything to his own curiosity. He even
considered himself happy. And now Joana had come to him,
she, Joana who... He wanted to add one more word to this
muddled thought, the right word, the difficult one, but once
again he was struck by the idea that he no longer needed to
think, that he needed nothing, nothing... she would soon be
here. But listen: soon... It was like this: Joana had liberated
him. Increasingly he needed less in order to live: he thought
less, ate less, slept very little. She always existed. And she
would soon be here.
He closed his eyes more tightly, bit his lips, suffering without
knowing why. He opened his eyes immediately and in the
room — the empty room! — suddenly he could find no sign of
Joana having been there. As if her existence were a lie... He
straightened up. Come, something ardent and mortal called out
inside him. Come, he repeated in a low voice, overcome with
fear, looking forlorn. Come...
Footsteps, almost silent, were treading the dry leaves outside.
Once more Joana was coming... once more she could hear
him from afar.
He remained standing beside the bed, his eyes vacant, a blind
man listening to distant music. She was drawing closer ... and
closer.. .Joana was coming. Her footsteps became more and
more real, the only reality. Joana. With the suddenness of a
stab wound, the pain exploded inside her body, illuminated her
with happiness and bewilderment.
When the door opened to Joana, he ceased to exist. He had
slipped to the very depths of himself, he hovered in the
penumbra of his own unsuspected labyrinth. He now moved
lightly and his gestures were agile and new. The pupils of his
eyes became dark and dilated, suddenly transformed into a
slender creature, as nervous as a colt. Meanwhile the
atmosphere had become so lucid that he could perceive the
slightest movement from any living thing around him. And his
body was simply recent memory, where sensations would adapt
themselves as if for the first time.
The tiny white ship floated over rough waves, green, brilliant
and unruly — he saw her lying there, studying the tiny picture
on the wall.
— On the third, Joana continued in a soft, clear voice, with
small rounded intervals, on the third, there was a grand
parade on behalf of new-born infants. It was amusing to watch
people singing and carrying flags full of all the non-colours.
Then a man got up as feeble and swift as the breeze that
blows when someone is sad and calls from afar: I. No one
heard him, but he was almost satisfied. And just then the
mighty gale started up that blows from the north-east and
trampled over everyone with its great fiery feet. Everyone
returned to their homes, wilting and scorched by the heat.
They pulled off their shoes, loosened their collars. Their blood
ran slowly, trickling through their veins. And the most awful
feeling of not-having-anything-to-do crept into their souls. In the
meantime, the earth continued to go round. That was when a
little boy was born and given a name. The child was beautiful.
Enormous eyes that saw, delicate lips that felt, a thin little face
that felt, a high forehead that felt. His head large. He walked
like someone who really knows the place, slipping effortlessly
among the crowd. Anyone following him would arrive. When he
was moved, when he was surprised, he shook his head, slowly
like this, like someone being offered more than he expected.
He was beautiful. And above all, he was alive. And above all, I
loved him. I was born, I was born, I was born. Now a verse.
The thing I wish for, my darling, is to see you always, my
darling. As I saw you today, my darling. Even should you die,
my darling. Another verse: I once heard a flower sing and
quietly rejoiced: Then drawing near, what wonder did I find,
not a singing flower, but a bird hovering there.
Joana's words tailed off as if she were dreaming. Through her
half-closed eyes, the ship floated to one side in the picture, the
objects in the room were strung out and luminous, one object
growing from another. For if we already knew 'that everything
was one', why go on seeing and living? The man, his eyes
closed, had buried his head on her shoulder and listened to
her dreaming without sleeping. From time to time, she heard
within the living silence of that summer afternoon, muffled,
unhurried movements coming from the creaking floorboards. It
was the woman, the woman, that woman.
On those first visits to the big house, Joana had felt like asking
the man the following questions: Is she now like a mother to
you? Is she no longer your lover? Even though I exist, does
she still want you to live with her? But she had always held
back. Meanwhile, the presence of the other woman was so
powerful in the house, that the three of them formed a couple.
And Joana and the man never felt themselves to be entirely
alone. Joana had also wanted to ask the woman herself: But
this had been an earlier thought. For one day she had caught
a glimpse of her, the woman's broad shoulders concentrated
into an indissoluble lump of anguish beneath her black lace
dress. She had also watched her at other fleeting moments,
passing from one of the rooms into the lounge, giving a quick
smile, rushing off with a horrible expression on her face. Then
Joana had discovered that she was someone alive and black.
Big ears, sad and heavy, with a dark orifice like a cave. The
simpering, furtive, inviting glance of a whore, without glory. Her
lips moist, chapped, large, smothered in lipstick. How she must
love the man. Her hair was fine and sparse and reddish from
constant dyeing. And the room where the man slept and
received Joana, that room with curtains, almost free of dust,
had in all certainty been tidied up by her. Like someone
sewing her own child's shroud. Joana, that woman and the
teacher's wife. What was it that finally united them? The three
diabolical graces.
— Almonds… Joana said, turning to the man. The mystery and
sweetness of words: almond... listen, pronounced carefully, the
voice placed in the throat, resounding deep down in the
mouth. It vibrates, leaves me long and stretched and curved
like a bow. Almond, bitter, poisonous and pure.
The three graces, bitter, poisonous and pure.
— Remind me of that saying... — the man asked her.
— What saying?
— The one about the sailor. When you love a sailor, you love
the whole wide world.
— How awful... — Joana laughed. I know: I myself said that it
must be so true that it has always had that jingle. But I can't
remember the rest.
— He was spending his Sunday in the square. He was on the
pier... — the man helped her.
One day, breaking the silence which he kept up when he was
with Joana, he had tried to make conversation:
— I've never been much good.
— Yes, she replied.
But everything that's happened wouldn't make you go away...
— No.
— Even this woman... this house... It's different, can't you see?
— I do.
— I know that I've always been like a beggar. But I've never
asked for anything, there was no need and I didn't know. But
then you came. I used to think: nothing was bad. But now...
For you're always telling me such crazy things, believe me, I
can't...
At this point she raised herself on one elbow, suddenly looking
serious, her face bent over him: Do you believe in me?
— Yes... — he replied, startled by her violence.
— You know that I don't lie, that I never lie, not even when...
not even? Do you hear? Tell me, tell me. Then the rest
wouldn't matter, nothing would matter... When I say these
things... these crazy things, when I don't want to know about
your past, and I don't want to tell you anything about myself,
when I invent words... When I lie, do you feel that I'm not
lying?
— Of course, of course...
She was stretched out on the bed once more, her eyes closed,
weary. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if he doesn't believe
me afterwards, if he runs from me like the teacher. Meanwhile,
lying here beside him, she could think. And meanwhile is also
time. She opened her eyes and smiled at him. A little boy,
that's what he is. He must have had many women, been
much loved, he's attractive, with those long eyelashes, those
cold eyes. Before he was harder. I've mellowed him a little.
That woman is waiting for me to go away forever one day.
For him to return.
— What was he doing on Sunday in the square? The square
is wide and deserted, she finally said slowly, trying to
remember in order to answer his question: Yes... So much
sun, trapped on the ground as if it came from there. The sea,
the sea's swell, silent and breathless. The fishes on Sunday,
rapidly twirling their tails and tranquilly continuing to force their
way through. A stationary ship. Sunday. The sailors strolling
along the pier, through the square. A pink dress appearing and
disappearing round the corner. The trees crystallized on Sunday
— Sunday would remind you of Christmas trees — shining in
silence, holding their breath, like so, like so. A man out walking
with a woman in a new dress. The man wishes to be nothing,
he walks beside her, almost looking into her face, asking,
asking: tell me, bully me, trample me. She making no reply,
smiling, pure Sunday. Satisfaction, satisfaction. Pure sadness
without any heartache. Sadness that seems to come from
behind the woman in pink. The sadness of Sunday on the
pier, sailors on loan to terra firma. That gentle sadness is proof
of living. And since one doesn't know how to make use of this
sudden knowledge, there comes sadness.
— This time the story was different — he complained after a
pause.
— That's because I'm simply narrating what I saw, not what
I'm seeing. I'm incapable of repeating things, I only know
things once — she explained to him.
— It was different, but everything you see is perfect. He wore
a chain round his neck with a tiny gold medal.
On one side St Teresa, the Little Flower, and on the other side
St Christopher. He revered these two saints:
— But I don't pay much attention to saints. Just occasionally.
She had once told him that as a little girl she could spend a
whole afternoon playing with one word. So he would ask her
to invent some words. She had never loved him more than at
such moments.
— Tell me again what Lalande means — he implored Joana.
It's like angel's tears. Do you know what angel's tears are? A
kind of daffodil, the slightest breeze bends it backwards.
Lalande also means the sea at dawn, before anyone has set
eyes on the shore, before the sun has risen. Each time I say:
Lalande, you should hear the fresh and salty sea-breeze, you
should walk the length of the beach still covered in darkness,
slowly, stark naked. In a word, you will feel Lalande... You can
trust me, no one knows the sea better than I do.
He did not know at certain moments if he was alive or dead,
if everything he possessed was little or too much. When she
spoke, she would invent like mad, like mad! Plenitude filled him,
as great as a charm, and his anguish was that of the clear
expanse above the water. Why did he feel intimidated in her
presence, as bewildered as a white wall in the moonlight? Or
he might suddenly awaken and call out: who is this woman?
she is superfluous in my life! I can't... I want to turn back...
But he no longer could — he suddenly sensed in terror,
realizing that he was lost.
— Dearest — she said, interrupting the man's thoughts.
— Yes, yes... — He hid his face on that comforting shoulder
and she remained there, listening to his breathing pervade her
back and forth, back and forth. They were both creatures.
What else matters? — she thought. He moved, rested his head
on her bare flesh like... like an insect, a flea blindly searching
for the nucleus, for the living centre. Or like a child. Outside,
the world slipped away, and day, day, then night, then day.
She would have to go at some time, to tear herself away once
more. He too. From her? Yes, soon she would become a
burden to him with her surfeit of miracles. Like other people,
inexplicably ashamed of himself, he would long to be off. But
as an act of revenge: he would not free himself entirely. He
would end up being surprised at himself, compromising himself,
haunted by an uncertain and anguished feeling of responsibility.
Joana smiled. He would finish up hating her, as if she were
demanding something from him. Like her aunt, her uncle, who
respected her even though suspecting that she did not enjoy
their pleasures. In some confused way, they imagined her to be
superior and despised her. Oh God, once more she was
remembering, telling her own story to herself, justifying herself.
She could ask the man for confirmation: am I like this? But
what did he know? She buried her face on his shoulder, hid
herself, possibly happy at that moment. To shake him, to tell
him: Joana was man like this, man. And so she became a
woman and grew old. She believed herself to be very powerful
and felt happy. So powerful that she imagined she had chosen
these paths before venturing there — simply by thinking about
them. So unhappy that, believing herself to be powerful, she
didn't know what to do with her power and saw each minute
as being lost because she had failed to guide it towards some
objective. That's how Joana grew, man, as tall and slender as
a pine tree, and full of courage, too. Her courage had grown
inside the room plunged into darkness and luminous worlds
had formed, without fear or shame. She learned from
childhood to think, and since she had never seen any human
being up close except herself, she was deceived, suffered, lived
a painful pride, sometimes superficial but nearly always difficult
to bear. How can one end Joana's story? If she could gather
and magnify the look I spied in Lídia: no one will love you...
yes, let's end it like this: despite her being one of those free
and solitary creatures in the world, no one ever thought of
giving anything to Joana. Not love, they always offered her
some other sentiment. She lived her life, eager as a virgin —
that's to say, for the tomb. She asked herself lots of questions,
but was never able to provide the answers: she paused in
order to listen. How did a triangle come to exist? Was it an
idea to begin with? or did that come after it had found its
form? Was a triangle fated to exist? things were beautiful. —
She would have liked to linger over the question. But love
invaded her. Triangle, circle, straight lines... as harmonious and
mysterious as a harp. Where is music stored when it isn't
playing? — she asked herself. And lost in thought, she replied:
let them make a harp from my nerves when I die.
The last of Joana's lucidity merged with the crooked ship
moving over the waves. She only had to nod her head for the
waves to accompany it. But she had had something, oh yes
she had. A husband, breasts, a lover, a house, books, bobbed
hair, an aunt, a teacher. Auntie, listen to me, I've met Joana,
the one I'm telling you about. She was a weak woman in
relation to things. At times, everything seemed to her to be too
precise, untouchable. And, sometimes, what others used as air
for breathing, became a burden and death for her. See if you
can understand my heroine, Auntie, listen. She's vague and
bold. She doesn't love, no one loves her. You would end up
noticing it just as Lídia, another woman — a young woman
full of her own destiny — noticed it. However what's inside
Joana is something stronger than the love one gives and
what's inside her demands more than the love one receives.
Do you see what I mean, Auntie?
I wouldn't call her a hero like the one I promised Daddy. For
in her there was a terrible fear. A fear preceding any
judgement or understanding. — This has just occurred to me:
who knows, perhaps faith in future survival comes from
noticing that life always leaves us untouched.
— Do you understand, Auntie?  — I forget the interruption of
future life — do you understand? I can see your open eyes
watching me with fear, with mistrust, yet wanting, nevertheless,
as an affectionate old woman — now dead, it's true, now dead
— to love me, overlooking my cruelty. Poor thing! the worst
rebellion I ever sensed in you, apart from the ones I provoked,
can be summed up in that saying you repeated nearly every
day, and which I can still hear, mingled with your scent which
I shall never forget: 'If only we could go out in the clothes
we're wearing!' What more can I tell you? I've had my hair
cut short, tinted brown, sometimes I wear it in a fringe. I'm
going to die one day. I've also been born. There was the room
with the two of them. He was good-looking. The room went
round a little. It became transparent and warm, a veil that
kept coming closer and closer. The three of them formed a
couple, but to whom could she tell this? She would be able to
sleep because the man never slept and he would keep watch
like the falling rain. Otávio was also good-looking, with those
eyes of his. This was a child an insect flowers whiteness
warmth as sleep is for the moment time for the moment life
itself that later... Everything like the earth a child Lídia a child
Otávio earth De profundis...
 
The Viper
It's as if I were gently penetrating something...
Otávio read while the clock ticked away the seconds and broke
the night's silence with eleven strokes.
It's as if I were gently penetrating something...
There's the impression. This lightness comes from who knows
where. Curtains droop languidly over their own cords. But
there is also the black march, at a standstill, two eyes staring,
unable to say anything. God perched on a tree and twittering,
and straight lines running, unfinished, horizontal and cold.
That's the impression... Mature moments go on dripping and
no sooner does one fall than another surfaces, softly, its face
pallid and minute. Suddenly the moments too come to an end.
The without-time runs down my walls, tortuous and blind. Little
by little, it accumulates in a dark and tranquil lake and I call
out: I have lived!
Night silenced the things outside, some toad or other croaked
intermittently. Each shrub was an unmoving, recoiling face.
In the distance, there glimmered and flickered tiny reddish
lights, sleepless eyes. In the darkness like that of water. The
tall, slender sunflowers lit up the garden by stages.
What was one to think at that moment? She was so pure and
free that she could choose and didn't know. She could see
something, but she couldn't express it, not even mentally, for
the image had become tenuous in the darkness of her body.
She simply sensed it and looked expectantly through the
window as if she were seeing her own face in the night.
Would this be the most she could hope to achieve?
To approach herself, to approach herself, to almost touch, only
to feel the ebbing wave behind her, firmly and gently sucking
her in, engulfing her then leaving her with the startling and
intangible memory of a hallucination... Even at that moment,
perceiving the night and her own vague thoughts, she was still
detached from them, forever that small impenetrable mass,
looking on, looking on. That tiny light gleaming in silence,
remote, solitary, unconquered. She never surrendered.
She looked around her, the room slowly panting, poorly lit as
in a spell of vertigo. She raised her head a little, examined the
space and became aware of the rest of the house which was
lost in darkness, the objects, grave and indistinct, floating
around the corners. She would have to grope her way the
moment she went through the door. Especially if she were a
child, in her aunt's house, waking up at night, her mouth dry,
going to look for some water. Knowing that people were
isolated, every one of them locked inside this secret,
impenetrable sleep. Especially if she were that child and as on
that night or those nights, upon crossing the pantry she should
discover the moonlight settled in the yard as in a cemetery,
that wind free and uncertain... especially if she were that
frightened child she would bump into objects she couldn't make
out in the dark which when touched would suddenly contract
into chairs and tables, into barriers, with open, unfeeling,
relentless eyes. So they too were imprisoned. After that knock,
the pain, the moonlight stripping the terrace of cement, thirst
rising up through her body like some memory. Deep silence in
the house, the neighbouring rooftops motionless and livid...
Once more, Joana tried to go back into the room, into the
presence of Otávio. She was rid of things, of her own things,
created by her and alive. Were they to abandon her in the
desert, amidst the solitary glaciers, in any spot on Earth, she
would preserve the same white, limp hands, the same, almost
serene aloofness. She would take a bundle of clothes and
slowly go away. Not to escape, but to go away.
Just like that, so comforting. Not to escape, but to go away ...
Or to shout aloud, aloud, straight and infinite, with her eyes
closed and tranquil. To walk until she encountered those tiny
red lights. Flickering as if going out or coming on. Was she
also about to die or be born? No, not to go: to remain
trapped by the moment just as a pensive look clings to the
void, quiet, suspended in mid-air...
The vibration of a distant tram pervaded her as if she were a
tunnel. A night train passing through a tunnel. Goodbye. No,
anyone travelling at night simply looks through the window and
doesn't wave goodbye. No one knows where the hovels are,
the unwashed bodies are murky and require no light.
— Otávio — she said, for she was lost.
Joana's voice, expressionless, light and direct, blotted out the
room. He raised his eyes:
— What is it? — he enquired. And his voice was full of flesh
and blood, it assembled the room inside the room, it labelled
and defined things. A gust of air reviving the flames. The
crowd had invaded the empty square.
She struggled for a moment, shuddered, woke up. Everything
was shining under the lamp, tranquil and happy as round the
hearth. Within the shadows of her body, the futility of waiting
pervaded her somnambulism like a bird winging through the
night.
— Otávio — she repeated.
He was waiting. Then once more conscious of the room, of
the man and of herself, her own flames gathered strength, she
knew that she should proceed logically, that the man expected
her to go on. She looked for a signal, a plea, some definite
word:
— I have the impression that you only came to give me a
child, she said, and only now have I had the opportunity to
fulfil the promise I made to Lídia. Even to go on wanting the
child would mean tying herself to the future.
Otávio stared at her for a second in amazement, drained of
any affection.
— But — he murmured after some time, his voice faltering,
timid and hoarse — but can't you see that everything is almost
finished between us?
— And has been almost from the start... he ventured.
— It will only finish when I've had a child — she replied,
vague and obstinate.
Otávio opened his eyes in her direction, his face pale and
suddenly weary beneath the table-lamp, where his book lay
open.
— Isn't that a little far-fetched? — he asked ironically. She
ignored the remark:
— What existed between us is not enough. I still haven't given
you everything, you may come looking for me one day or I
might miss you. Although after the child is born, there will be
nothing left for us except to separate.
— And what about the child? — he enquired. — Where does
the child come into this clever arrangement?
— Oh, he'll survive — she replied.
— Is that all you have to say? — he rejoined with sarcasm.
— What else can one do? — she launched the question into
the air, casually, without expecting any answer.
Otávio, thinking she was waiting, despite his nervousness and
rage at having to obey her, concluded uncertainly:
— Be happy, for example.
Joana raised her eyes and watched him from afar with
surprise and a certain happiness — Why? — Otávio asked
himself in alarm. He became flustered as if he had cracked
some silly joke. She saw that he was angry, curled up in his
chair, hurt and dejected as if someone had spat in his face.
Without stirring, she leaned towards him, full of pity and more
than pity — she pursed her lips, embarrassed — a love full of
tears. She closed her eyes for a moment, trying not to see
him, not to love him any more. At heart she could still unite
herself with Otávio, he scarcely knew just how much. Perhaps
it was enough to tell him about her own fears, for example,
summarizing in words those feelings of shame and uneasiness
when she summoned the waiter in a loud voice and everyone
heard her except the waiter who wasn't listening. She laughed.
Otávio would like to know about this. She could also unite
herself with him by summing up for him her urge to escape
whenever she found herself among smiling men and women
and she found it difficult to relate to them or experience her
own body. Or perhaps she was mistaken and these confidences
did not bring them closer together. Just as when she was a
little girl and she used to imagine that, if she could tell
someone about the 'mystery of the dictionary', she would link
herself forever to that someone... Like this: after the l it was
useless looking for the i
... Even for the l
, the letters were
companions, scattered like beans over the kitchen table. But
after the l
, they scattered solemn and compact and you could
never find, for example, an easy letter like a among them. She
smiled, opened her eyes little by little and now relaxed,
subdued, she could confront him with disdain.
— You know perfectly well that's not the point. Oh, Otávio,
Otávio... she murmured after an instant, the flames suddenly
revived — what's happening to us when all is said and done,
what's happening to us?
Otávio's voice was gruff and sharp when he replied:
— You always left me on my own.
— No... — she said nervously. — It's just that everything I
have cannot be given. Nor taken. I myself am capable of dying
of thirst in my own presence. Solitude is mingled with my
essence...
— No — he repeated stubbornly, his eyes wild. — You always
left me on my own because that's what you wanted, because
that's what you wanted.
— I'm not to blame -Joana cried out — believe me... It's
engraved in me that solitude comes because each body
inevitably has its own end, it's engraved in me that love ceases
with death... My presence has always been branded like this...
— When I got to know you — he said sardonically — I
thought you were going to teach me something more than this.
I needed — he went on in a lower tone — what I perceived
in you, yet you always denied me.
— No, no... — she protested in a weak voice — Believe me,
Otávio, the things I really knew penetrated my skin, came upon
me almost by stealth... Everything I know I never learned, nor
could I ever teach it to others.
They fell silent for a second. In a fleeting moment Joana saw
herself seated beside her father, a ribbon in her hair, in a
waiting-room. Her father with his hair unkempt, rather grubby,
perspiring, his mood jovial. She could feel the ribbon more
than anything else. She had been playing in her bare feet and
had pulled on her shoes in haste without washing them and
now they were creaking noisily inside the leather. How could
her father be so cheerful, how could he fail to see that the
two of them were the most miserable of people, and that no
one was as much as looking at them? But she wished to
prove to everyone that she would go on as she was, that he
was her father, that she would protect him, that she would
never wash her feet. She saw herself seated beside her father
and she didn't know what had occurred immediately before
dinner and immediately afterwards. Nothing but a shadow and
she took refuge in it, listening to the music of confusion
murmuring in her depths, intangible, blind.
— Nevertheless — Otávio went on — you yourself said: there
is a certain moment in the joy of being able to do something
which exceeds the fear itself of death. Two persons who live
together — he continued in a whisper — try perhaps to attain
that moment. You didn't want to.
She said nothing. When she didn't reply, he became uneasy,
he went back to the days of his childhood, people angry with
him, obliging him to promise, to please them, full of apologies.
He recalled some offence or other he had once committed
regarding Joana and tried to rid himself of it immediately so
that it might nevermore weigh on his conscience. And even
though aware that he was about to say something irrelevant,
he could not restrain himself: You're right Joana: everything
that comes to us is brute matter, but there is nothing in
existence that escapes transfiguration — he began and his
expression immediately became one of utter embarrassment
when confronted by Joana's eyebrows. He forced himself to
continue — Don't you remember telling me one day: 'Today's
sorrow will be tomorrow's happiness; there is nothing in
existence that escapes transfiguration.' Don't you remember?
Perhaps it wasn't exactly with those words...
— I remember.
Well... At that moment I couldn't really grasp what you were
trying to say. I even got annoyed I suppose...
— I know —Joana said. — You told me that if you had a
stomach upset, I should come to lay the same absurd
extravagance at your feet.
— Yes, yes, you're quite right — Otávio said impatiently. I seem
to remember that you weren't even intimidated. But ... listen, I
don't think I ever told you: I realized afterwards that there was
no exaggeration in what you'd said... I don't think I ever
confessed this to you, or am I wrong? Look, I'm even inclined
to believe that there might be some truth in those words.
There is nothing in existence that escapes transfiguration.. .He
blushed. — Perhaps that's the secret, perhaps that's what I
perceived in you... There are certain presences which allow
transfiguration.
Since she remained silent, he insisted further.
— You promise too much... All the possibilities you offer people,
within themselves, with a look... I'm at a loss to explain it.
And just as she hadn't shown herself to be proud or
diminished when he had first spoken ironically about her
absurd extravagance, she didn't now gloat over Otávio's
humility. He looked at her. Once again he had not known how
to attach himself to that woman. Once more she defeated him.
There was silence in the room and the light and emptiness
settled on the white keys of the open piano. Something had
died, slowly and truly died. It would be useless to reunite the
happiness of living with that moment.
— What comes next? — Otávio murmured, and this time he
had succumbed to the essence of things, he had been drawn
to Joana's truth.
— I don't know — she said.
Otávio studied her. What was on her mind, she seemed so
remote? She appeared to be hovering in the centre of
something mobile, her body floating, unsupported, almost
non-existent. Just as when she started to relate things from the
past and he could see that she was lying. Then Joana's head
would slowly wander, she would gently incline her forehead,
raise it again, begin to stammer. There was a calculated and
solid nucleus to begin with but then everything became fluent
and innocuous. And Otávio would look at her, oblivious of
himself. He would end up in a state of anguish, for if he
wanted to touch her he couldn't, there was an intangible circle
around that creature, which was impenetrable and kept her
apart. Bitterness then possessed him because he could not
perceive her as a woman and his quality as a man became
futile, and he was incapable of being anything other than a
man. In cousin Isabel's garden white roses grew all those years
ago. He had often admired them, perplexed, not knowing how
to possess them, because in the presence of those roses his
only power, that of a human being, was useless. He put them
to his face, to his lips, he inhaled their perfume. They went on
quivering, delicate and luxuriant. If only they had thick petals —
he used to think — if only they were hard... if only their petals
would give a dry sound when they dropped and hit the
ground... Feeling the heightening beauty of those flowers
penetrate him, like that of Joana, like that of Joana when she
lied, he was seized by an impotent fury: he would crush them,
chew them, destroy them.
Looking at her now, without quite knowing how to define that
face, he wanted to revive that old feeling, to find himself once
more in cousin Isabel's garden.
But in the absence of any other thought, he suddenly realized
that Joana would go away. Yes, he would carry on, he had
Lídia, the child, himself. She would go away, he knew... But
what did it matter, he didn't need Joana. No, 'he didn't need
her', yet he 'couldn't do without her'. And suddenly he just
couldn't fathom how he had managed to live with her for so
long. It struck him that after her departure he would simply
have to untie the present to that distant past, cousin Isabel's
house, Lídia, his bride-to-be, his plans to write a substantial
book, his personal traumas, tepid, sweet and loathsome as
depravity; to that past barely interrupted by Joana. It would be
nice to be rid of her, to draw up plans for his book on Civil
Law. He could already picture himself moving among his things
with intimacy.
But he also saw himself with strange and sudden clarity, one
evening perhaps, feeling a twinge of pain in his chest, screwing
up his eyes, aware that his hands were empty without even
looking at them. The indefinable feeling of loss when Joana
might leave him... She would surge inside him, not in his head
like any familiar reminiscence, but in the centre of his body,
vague and lucid, interrupting his existence like the sudden
clanging of a bell. He would suffer as if she were telling the
most outrageous lies, yet as if he were unable to expel that
hallucination and were progressively inhaling it like air inside his
body which might thankfully turn into water. He would feel the
clean, open space inside his heart where none of Joana's seeds
would bring afforestation, for she was as inviolate as future
thought. Nevertheless, she was his, yes, deeply, diffusely, like
some music one has heard. You're mine, mine, don't leave me!
— he implored her from the depths of his being.
But he would not utter such words for he wanted her to go,
he wouldn't know what to do with Joana if she were to stay.
He would go back to Lídia, pregnant and swollen. He gradually
realized that he had chosen to renounce all that was most
precious in his being, that tiny suffering portion which he
succeeded in living beside Joana. And after a moment of
suffering, as if he were abandoning himself, his eyes shining
with fatigue, he sensed the futility of desiring something more
for the future. Perplexed, he was finally witnessing his own
strange, intense purification, as if he were slowly penetrating an
inorganic world.
— Do you really want a child? — he asked her. Terrified of
the solitude into which he had ventured, he suddenly wanted
to link himself to life, to lean on Joana until he could lean on
Lídia, just as someone crossing an abyss clings to tiny boulders
before clambering up the rock itself.
We shouldn't know how to make it live... came Joana's voice.
— Yes, you're right... he said uneasily. And he passionately
longed to be with Lídia. To go back to her forever. He realized
that this would be his last night with Joana, the last, the last...
— No... perhaps I'm right, Joana continued. Perhaps one
shouldn't think about any of this before having a child. One
lights a bright lamp, everything becomes clear and safe, one
drinks tea each afternoon, embroiders, but above all, a lamp
brighter than this one. And the child lives. That's quite true...
so true that you had no fears for the life of Lídia's child...
Otávio did not flinch, he didn't as much as blink. But his
whole being shrank and his pallor shone like a lit candle.
Joana went on speaking at her leisure, but he didn't hear her
because little by little, almost without thinking, fury surfaced in
his heavy heart, dulled his hearing, clouded his vision. What...
fury, stumbling and panting, raged inside him, so she knew
about Lídia, about the child... she knew and kept silent... She
deceived me... — That stifling burden weighed even more
deeply inside him. She quietly condoned my infamy... she
continued to sleep with me, to tolerate me... for how long?
Why? but why, dear God!...
— Bitch.
Joana jumped, lifted her head rapidly.
— You're despicable.
His voice could scarcely control itself in that swollen throat, the
veins on his neck and forehead stood out, thick and knotted,
in triumph.
— It was your aunt who once called you a viper. Yes, a viper.
Viper! Viper! Viper!
He was now shouting wildly, unable to control himself. Each
cry could barely release itself from that convulsed source,
vibrated almost gleefully in mid-air.
She watched him beat his fists on the table, maddened,
weeping with fury. For how long? Because Joana was aware,
as if listening to music in the distance, that everything
continued to exist and that those cries were not separate
arrows, but were merging with what existed. Until suddenly
spent and empty, he slumped into a chair. His face numb, his
eyes dead, he sat staring at the floor.
Both of them sank into solitary and peaceful silence. Perhaps
years passed. Everything was as bright as an eternal star and
they hovered so quietly that they could feel future time clearly
revolving inside their bodies with the denseness of the long past
which instant by instant they had just lived.
Until the first light of dawn began to disperse the night. In the
garden, the darkness frayed like a veil and the sunflowers
trembled in the nascent breeze. Dim lights, however, still
flickered in the far distance as if coming from the sea.
 
The Man's Departure
The following day she received a note from the man saying
goodbye:
'I've had to go away for a spell, I had to go, they came to
look for me, Joana. I'll be back, I'll be back, wait for me. You
know that I'm nothing, I'll be back. I shouldn't even be able to
see and hear if it weren't for you. If you abandon me, I'll go
on living a little longer, the time a little bird can stay in mid-air
without flapping its wings, then I'll drop, I'll drop from the sky
and die. Joana. The only thing that prevents me from dying
this very moment is that I'll be back. I can't explain it but
through you I'm able to see. God help me and You, for there
is no one like you. I'll be back. I never spoke all that much to
you, but it was out of kindness: I'm not breaking my promise
am I? I understand you so well, so well, should You want
anything from me, you need only ask. May God bless you,
here's my little medal with St Christopher and St Teresa of
Lisieux.'
She folded the note carefully. She recalled the man's face
during those last days, his eyes running and bleary like those
of a mangy cat. And the skin around them, livid and inflamed
like the gloaming. Where had he gone? His life was
undoubtedly confused. A confusion of facts. And she had the
impression that in a sense he was disconnected from those
facts. The woman who sustained him, that distraction in relation
to himself, like someone who has had no beginning and
expects no end... Where had he gone? He had suffered a
great deal during those last days. She should have spoken to
him, he had truly expected it, but afterwards, distracted and
thoughtless, she had forgotten.
Where had he gone? — she wondered, her arms empty. The
whirlwind spun round and round and set her down once
more at the beginning of the road. She looked at the note with
its delicate, indecisive lettering, the phrases written with care
and difficulty. Once again, she could see her lover's face and
she couldn't help admiring those striking features. She closed
her eyes for a second, inhaled once more the odour that came
from the gloomy corridors of that unexplored house, with only
one room revealed, where she had experienced love anew. The
smell of old apples, sweet and old, coming from the walls, from
their depths. Once again, she could see the narrow bed which
had been replaced by a large, soft one, the nervous pleasure
with which the man had opened the door that day and seen
Joana's face, taking her by surprise. The tiny ship, almost
submerged by the exceedingly green waves. She half-closed her
eyes and the ship lurched. But everything had slid over her,
nothing had possessed her... In brief, a mere pause, a single
note, weak and pure. It was she who had violated that man's
soul, who had filled it with a light whose evil he still hadn't
fathomed. She herself had scarcely been touched. A pause, a
note, faint and without any resonance...
Once more a circle of life that was closing. And she herself in
Otávio's tranquil and silent house, sensing his absence in each
place where only the day before his things had still existed and
where there was now a void lightly covered in dust.
Fortunately, she hadn't seen him leave. And fortunately, during
those first moments, upon noticing her dismay that he had
gone, she still believed she possessed her lover. 'Upon noticing
that Otávio had gone'...? — she thought. But why lie? The
person who had gone was herself and even Otávio knew it.
She changed out of the clothes she had worn to visit the man.
That woman with the moist, loose lips must be suffering, alone
and old in that big house. Joana didn't even know his name...
She didn't want to know it, she had assured him: I want to
know you through other sources, to pursue your soul along
other roads; I want nothing of your past life, neither your
name, nor your dreams, nor to hear of your sufferings, the
mystery clarifies more than any revelation; and I forbid you to
start probing anything about me. I am Joana, you are a living
body, I am a living body, that's all.
What a fool, what a fool, perhaps she might have tolerated
and loved him then had she known his name, been aware of
his hopes and sufferings. It's true that the silence between
them might have been more perfect. But what was the use ...
They were simply living bodies. No, no, even better like this:
each with a body, driving it onwards, eagerly seeking to get the
most out of it. Avidly trying to climb over the other, pleading,
full of cunning and touching cowardice for a better existence, a
better existence. She interrupted herself, holding her dress in
one hand, alert and liberated. She became aware of the
solitude in which she found herself, at the centre of an empty
house. She sensed that Otávio was with Lídia, a fugitive beside
that pregnant woman, full of seeds for the world.
She went to the window, felt the cold air on her bare
shoulders, watched the earth where the plants were thriving
peacefully. The globe was moving and she was standing on it.
Beside a window, the sky overhead, clear, infinite. It was
useless to take refuge in the suffering of every love affair, to
rebel against events, for the facts were simply a tear in her
dress, the silent arrow pointing to the heart of things, a river
that dries up leaving the river-bed exposed.
The chilly night air brought her skin out in goose-pimples;
Joana found it difficult to think clearly — there was something
in the garden that dislocated her from the centre, causing her
to waver... She remained on the alert. Something was trying to
move inside her, responding, and through the dark cavities of
her body, waves came surging, light, fresh and ancient. Almost
frightened, she wanted to bring that feeling to her
consciousness, but found herself being pulled further and
further back in sweet vertigo, by gentle fingers. As if it were
morning. She examined herself, suddenly alert as if she had
advanced too far. Morning?
Morning. Where had she once been, in what strange and
miraculous land had she set foot to be now inhaling its
perfume? Dry leaves on the moist ground. Her heart slowly
contracted, opened, she did not breathe for a moment, waiting
... It was morning, she knew that it was morning... Withdrawing
as if being led by a child's delicate hand, she heard, muffled as
in a dream, chickens scratching at the soil. A warm, dry soil...
the clock chiming ping... ping... the sun showering tiny yellow
and red roses over the houses... God, what was that if not she
herself? but when? not always...
The pink waves darkened, the dream fled. What was it that I
lost? what was it that I lost? It wasn't Otávio, already far away,
it wasn't her lover, the wretched man had never existed. It
occurred to her that the latter must be trapped, she pushed
the thought from her mind impatiently, escaping, rushing
headlong... As if everything were part of the same madness,
she suddenly heard a nearby cockerel ring out its vigorous and
solitary cry. But it isn't daybreak, she said trembling, smoothing
her cold forehead... The cockerel didn't know it was about to
die! The cockerel didn't know it was about to die! Yes, yes
Daddy, what is there for me to do? Ah, she had lost the
rhythm of a minuet... Yes... the clock had chimed ping, she
had stood on tiptoe and the world had turned much more
slowly at that moment. Were there flowers somewhere? And
she felt a great desire to melt away until her fibres merged
with the beginning of things. To form but one substance,
rose-coloured and sweet — breathing gently like a rising and
falling womb... Or was she wrong and was that feeling real?
Was what existed in that remote instant something green and
obscure, the anticipation of continuance, and impatient or
patient innocence? empty space... What word could convey just
then that something had not condensed and lived more freely?
Open eyes floating amidst withering leaves, white clouds, and
way down below the countryside stretched out as if it were
embracing the earth. And now... Perhaps she might have
learned to speak, only this. But the words floated on the
surface of her impenetrable sea, and they were hard. Before
the sea was pure. And all that remained of the past, flowing
within, light and tremulous, was a little of that ancient water
amidst gravel, sombre and cool under the trees, the dead
leaves and chestnuts covering the verges. God, how sweetly she
plunged into incomprehension of herself. And how much easier
still, to abandon herself to that ebbing tide, firm and gentle.
And to return. She would have to reunite herself to herself one
day, without those hard and solitary words... She would have
to merge herself and become once more the sea mute unruly
powerful wide motionless blind living. Death would unite her
with infancy.
But the iron gate was made by men: and there it was
gleaming beneath the sun. She observed this and the shock of
this sudden perception made her a woman once more. She
trembled, lost in a dream. She wanted to go back, she wanted
to go back. What was she thinking about? Ah, death would
unite her with infancy. But now her eyes, turned outwards,
had become cold, now death was different, since men made
the iron gate and since she was woman... Death ... And
suddenly death was merely cessation... No! she cried out in
terror, not death.
She now ran ahead of herself, already remote from Otávio and
from the man who had disappeared. She mustn't die. For...truly
where was the death inside her? — she slowly asked herself,
with cunning. She opened her eyes wide, still not believing in
this question, so novel and fascinating, which she had allowed
herself to invent. She walked up to the mirror, looked at
herself- still alive! Her pale neck sprouting from delicate
shoulders, still alive! -searching for herself. No, listen! listen! the
beginning of death did not exist inside her! And as if she were
violently pervading her own body, searching, she felt an
upsurge of vitality, her whole body opening up to breathe...
So she couldn't die, she then thought slowly. Little by little this
fragile thought took a deep breath, expanded, became compact
and solid, like a block adapting to its form. There was no
space for another presence, no room for doubt. Her heart
pounding furiously, she listened carefully. She burst out
laughing, a tremulous, bubbling laugh. No... But it was so
clear... No, she wouldn't die because... because she could not
end. That was it, that was it. A sudden apparition, that of a
little old man, perhaps a woman, several blurred human forms
merged into one, shaking its head, denying, growing old. No,
she told them quietly from the depths of her new truth, no...
the forms gradually faded, for she had always been. For her
body had never needed anyone, she was free. She walked
through the streets. She drank water, she had abolished God,
the world, everything. She would not die. It was so easy. She
stretched out her hands not knowing what to do with them
now that she knew. Perhaps she should caress herself, kiss
herself, filled with curiosity and gratitude upon recognizing
herself. No longer adhering to reason, it seemed to her that it
was so illogical to die, that she checked herself, now bewildered
and filled with terror. Eternal? Violent... The most fleeting
reflections and as brilliant as sparks criss-crossing like electric
currents, merging as sensations rather than as thoughts. She
altered without transition, in tiny leaps, from place to place,
ever higher, clearer and more tense. And from one moment to
the next, she fell more deeply within herself, into caverns of
milky light, breathing loudly, filled with fear and joy because of
the journey, perhaps like those sudden descents when one is
asleep. The intuition that those moments were fragile made her
stir herself gently, fearful of touching herself, of disturbing and
dissolving that miracle, the tender creature of light and air who
was trying to live inside her.
Once more, she slipped to the window, breathing cautiously.
Plunged into a happiness so perfect and intense almost like the
chill of ice, almost like the perception of music. Her lips began
to tremble, made her look serious. Eternal, eternal. Brilliant and
confused, broad tracts of land the colour of chestnuts were
succeeded by green, sparkling rivers, coursing with fury and
melody. Liquids glowing like flames pouring into her transparent
body as if it were an enormous vessel... She herself growing
on the smothered earth, dividing into thousands of living
particles, filled with her thoughts, her strength, her
unawareness...Smoothly crossing the cloudless sky, travelling,
flying...
A bird flew slanting into the distance!
It penetrated the clear atmosphere and disappeared into the
dense foliage of a tree.
Silence was left behind, palpitating in tiny whispers. How long
had she been observing it, without feeling anything?
Ah, so she would die.
Yes, she would die. As simply as the bird had flown. She tilted
her head to one side, gently like a harmless madwoman: but
it's easy, so easy...not even intelligent... it's death that will come,
that will come... How many seconds had passed? Several. Or
more. Cold. She perceived that by some miracle she had now
become conscious of those thoughts, that they were so deep
that they had passed beneath others that were material and
easy, simultaneously ... While she had lived the dream, she had
observed the things around her, she had used them mentally,
nervously, like someone pulling back the curtain to look at the
view. She closed her eyes, pleasantly serene and weary,
enshrouded in long, grey veils. For yet another moment, she
sensed the threat of incomprehension rising from the remote
interior of her body like a flux of blood. Eternity is non-being,
death is immortality — they were still floating, the scattered
remains after the storm. And she no longer knew where she
might secure them, she felt so weary.
Now the certainty of immortality had vanished forever. Perhaps
once or twice more in life — perhaps one late afternoon, in a
moment of love, at the moment of dying — she would achieve
sublime creative unconsciousness, the acute and blind intuition
that she was truly immortal for evermore.
 
The Journey
Impossible to explain. She gradually withdrew from that zone
where things have a set form and edges, where everything has
a solid and immutable name. Increasingly, she sank into that
fluid region, quiescent and unfathomable, where clouds hovered,
indistinct and fresh like those of dawn. Dawn breaking over the
countryside. On her uncle's farm she had woken up in the
middle of the night. The floorboards in the old house were
creaking. From up there on the first floor, free in that dark
space, she had looked out at the land, searching for those
plants that were writhing, coiled up like snakes. Something
blinked in the night, looking, looking, the eyes of an
outstretched dog on guard. The silence throbbed in her blood
and she gasped to its rhythm. The dawn broke over the fields,
rosy and moist. The plants were once more green and
ingenuous, their stems quivering, sensitive to the breeze,
emerging from death. There was no longer any dog guarding
the farm. Everything was now one, light, unconscious. At that
moment there was a horse running free through the silent
countryside, the movement of its legs barely visible. Everything
was imprecise, but suddenly in that imprecision she had found
a lucidity which she had scarcely perceived and hadn't been
able to possess entirely. Perturbed, she had thought: everything,
everything. The words are pebbles rolling in the river. That
wasn't happiness she had felt just then, but what she had felt
had been fluid, pleasantly amorphous, a shining moment, a
sombre moment. As sombre as the house that stood on the
road covered by dense trees and dust from the road. Inside
lived a barefooted old man and his two sons, big and
handsome breeders. The younger son had eyes, above all eyes.
He had once given her a kiss, one of the most satisfying
kisses she had ever experienced, and something rose from the
bottom of those eyes when she stretched out her hand. This
same hand, which was now resting on the back of the chair,
like some tiny separate body, satisfied, languid. As a child, she
used to make her hand dance, as if it were a delicate little
girl. She had made it dance even for the man who fled or
who had been caught, for her lover — and he, fascinated and
anguished, had ended up by squeezing it, by kissing it as if
that hand itself were a woman. Ah, she had experienced so
much, the farm, the man, the hours of waiting. Entire
summers, when she spent sleepless nights, which left her pale,
her eyes dark. Within her insomnia, other insomnias. She had
known certain odours. The smell of damp vegetation, trees and
plants illuminated by lights, where? In those days she had
trodden on the moist soil of flowerbeds, while the attendant
wasn't looking. Lights hanging from wires, swaying, like this,
meditating indifferently, music coming from the band-stand, the
black musicians sweating in their uniforms. The trees lit up, the
chilly, unreal atmosphere of prostitutes. And above all, there
was what cannot be expressed: eyes and a mouth spying from
behind the curtain, the eyes of a dog blinking from time to
time, a river rolling in silence and not knowing. Also: the plants
growing from seeds and dying. Also: in some remote place, a
sparrow perched on a branch and someone sleeping.
Everything dissolved. The farm, too, existed at that same
moment and at that same moment the hand of the clock
moved forward while her feeling of bewilderment found itself
overtaken by the clock.
Within herself she could feel the time she had lived
accumulating. It was an uncertain feeling like the memory of
some house in which she had lived. Not exactly of the house,
but of its location inside her, in relation to her father beating
on his typewriter, in relation to their neighbour's backyard and
the waning sunlight in the late afternoon. Obscure, remote and
silent. An instant... expired. And she was incapable of knowing
whether after this time she had lived there would be
continuation, renewal or nothing, like some barrier. No one was
preventing her from doing exactly the opposite of any of the
things that she might be about to do: no one, nothing... she
was not obliged to follow her own beginning... Did it bring pain
or pleasure? Meanwhile she felt that this strange freedom which
had been her downfall, which she had never linked even to
herself, that it was this freedom which was illuminating her
body. And she knew that it gave her life and her moments of
glory as the creative source of every future moment.
She had survived like an embryo that remained moist amidst
the parched and burning rocks, Joana mused. On that evening,
now grown old — a closed circle of life, a task completed —
on that evening when she had received the man's note, she
had chosen a new path. She mustn't escape, but go on. She
must use the money her father left behind and which had
never been touched, the inheritance she had so far
disregarded, she must go, go, be humble, suffer, totter on weak
foundations, lose any hopes. Above all, lose any hopes.
She loved her choice, and serenity now caressed her face,
allowing moments that were dead and gone to come to mind.
She must become one of those people without pride or shame
who confide in strangers at any time. And in this way, she
would link herself to infancy before death, by means of
nakedness. She must finally abase herself. How can I humiliate
myself sufficiently, how can I expose myself to the world and
death?
The ship swayed gently on the sea as if on gentle open hands.
She leaned over the deck-rail and felt tenderness rise slowly to
the surface, enveloping her in sadness.
On deck, the passengers strolled up and down, impatiently
waiting for tea to be served, anxious to reunite time with time.
Someone said, in a pained voice: look at the rain! A grey mist
was, in fact, encroaching, eyes closed. Very soon, large
raindrops could be seen falling on the wooden planks of the
deck, the noise of pins dropping as they hit the water,
imperceptibly piercing the surface. The wind grew cold, people
were raising the collars of their jackets, suddenly looking
anxious, fleeing from melancholy like Otávio with his fear of
suffering. De profundis...
De profundis?
Something was trying to speak... De profundis... To hear itself!
to take the fleeting opportunity that danced with agile feet on
the edge of the abyss. De profundis. To shut the doors of
consciousness. At first, to perceive corrupted water, foolish
phrases, but then amidst the confusion the thread of pure
water shimmering on the rough wall. De profundis. She must
approach with care, allow the first waves to trickle. De
profundis... She closed her eyes, but barely saw the penumbra.
She sank more deeply into thought, she saw a thin, immobile
figure outlined in bright red, the drawing she had made with
her blood-stained finger on a sheet of paper, when she had
scratched herself and her father went off to fetch the iodine. In
the darkness of those pupils, her thoughts aligned in
geometrical form, the one super-imposing itself on the other as
in a honeycomb, some empty cocoons, amorphous, without any
place for reflection. Soft, grey forms, like a cerebrum. But she
didn't really see this, she tried to imagine it perhaps. De
profundis. I can see a dream I once had: a dark, empty stage
behind a staircase. But the moment I think of 'dark stage' in
words, the dream evaporates and all that remains is the empty
cocoon. The sensation has faded and is purely mental. Until the
words 'dark stage' come to life inside me, in my darkness, in
my fragrance, to the point of becoming a shadowy vision,
frayed and intangible, but behind the staircase. Then once
more I shall possess a truth, my dream. De profundis. Why
does that voice wishing to speak not come? I am ready. I
close my eyes. Full of flowers that transform themselves into
roses while the insect quivers and advances in the direction of
the sun just as the vision is much more rapid than the word.
I choose the birth of the earth in order to... Meaningless. De
profundis, then the thread of pure water will come. I watched
the snow tremble full of rose-tinted clouds. To close one's eyes
and feel inspiration come tumbling down like a white cascade.
De profundis. My God, I await You. God, come to me, God,
burgeon in my breast. I am nothing and misfortune rains upon
my head. I only know how to use words and words are
treacherous and I continue to suffer, nothing in the end but
the thread on the dark wall. God, come to me for I have no
happiness and my life is as dark as a night without stars, and
God, why do You not exist inside me? Why did You make me
separate from You? God, come to me, I am nothing, I am less
than dust and I await You each day and night. Help me, I
only have one life and that life is trickling through my fingers
and serenely heading towards death and I can do nothing
except watch my life ebb away with each passing moment, I
am alone in the world, those who love me do not know me,
those who know me fear me and I am miserable and
impoverished and very soon I shall no longer know that I ever
existed. I have not much time left to live and what time is left
will meantime go on being untouched and useless. Take pity on
me, for I am nothing, give me what I need. God, give me
what I need whatever that may be, my desolation is as deep
as a well and I do not deceive myself before myself and
others. Come to me in my misfortune and that misfortune is
today, that misfortune is always, I kiss Your feet and the dust
on Your feet, I long to dissolve into tears, I call to You from
the depths, come to my assistance for I have committed no
sins, from the depths I call to You and no answer comes and
my despair is as arid as the desert sands and doubts stifle
and humiliate me. God, this vanity of living silences me, I am
nothing, from the depths I call to You, from the depths I call
to You from the depths I call to You from the depths I call to
You...
Her thoughts were now becoming coherent and she was
breathing like an invalid who had survived moments of crisis.
Something was still rumbling inside her, but she was quite
exhausted, and her face relaxed into a smooth mask with
vacant eyes. From the depths the final surrender. The end...
But first from the depths as a response, yes as a response,
enlivened by the air that was still penetrating her body, the
flame shot up, burning bright and pure... From the sombre
depths the inclement impulse burning, life rising anew, formless,
audacious, pitiful. A dry sob as if they had shaken her,
happiness shining in her breast, intense and unbearable, ah,
such turmoil. Above all, that constant stirring in the depths of
her being became clear... it was now growing and throbbing.
That stirring of some live thing trying to release itself from the
water in order to breathe. And how was she to fly, yes, how
was she to fly... walk along the shore and feel the wind on
her face, her hair blowing, glory on the mountain... Rising,
rising, her body opening itself to the atmosphere, surrendering
to the blind pulsation of her own blood, crystalline notes,
tintillating, glistening in her soul... There was still no
disenchantment before her own mysteries, oh God, God, God,
come to me, not to save me, salvation should be in me, but to
smother me with Your heavy hand, with punishment, with
death, because I am powerless and afraid of dealing that tiny
blow which will transform my whole body in this centre which
longs to breathe and which is rising, rising... the same impulse
as that of the tide and genesis, genesis! The tiny blow which
only allows mad thoughts to exist in the madman, the luminous
wound growing, hovering, overpowering. Oh, how she
harmonized with what she thought and how what she thought
was gloriously, oppressively fatal. I only want You God so that
You may take me in like a dog when everything may be once
more simply solid and complete, when the moment of bringing
one's head out of the waters might be nothing but a memory
and when inside me there might be nothing but knowledge,
which has been used and is used and by means of which
things are once more received and given, oh God.
What dominated in her was not courage, she was only
substance, less than human. How could she be a hero and
want to vanquish things? She was not woman, she existed, and
what was inside her were movements lifting her in constant
transition. Perhaps at some time she might have altered with
her savage strength the atmosphere around her and no one
had noticed, perhaps she had invented a new substance with
her breathing and she did not know, she merely sensed what
her tiny woman's head could never understand. Endless,
feverish thoughts sprang up and pervaded her startled body
and they were important in so far as they concealed a vital
impulse, they were important in so far as at the very moment
of their conception there was that blind and authentic
substance creating itself, rising and bulging out like a bubble of
air on the water's surface, almost breaking it... She was aware
that she still hadn't slept, she thought that she would still be
forced to burst into flames. That she would terminate once and
for all the prolonged gestation of childhood and that from her
painful immaturity her own being would explode, free at last, at
long last! No, no, no God, I want to be alone. And one day
there will appear, yes, one day there will appear in me, the
capacity, as red and affirmative as it is clear and sweet, one
day whatever I may do will be blindly securely unconsciously,
treading inside me, on my truth, so completely immersed in
whatever I might be doing that I shall be unable to speak;
above all, the day will come when my every movement will be
creation, birth, I shall break all the negations that exist within
me, I shall prove to myself that there is nothing to fear, that
everything that I might be will always be wherever there is a
woman who shares my origins. I shall raise within myself what
I am — one day, at a gesture from me, my mighty waves will
soar, pure water submerging my doubt, my conscience, I shall
be as strong as the soul of an animal and whenever I might
speak they will be slow, unthought words, not felt lightly, not
full of a desire for humanity, not the past consuming the
future! whatever I might say will sound preordained and
complete! there will be no space inside me for me to know
that time exists, that men and dimensions exist, there will be
no space inside me even to notice that I shall be creating
instant by instant, no, not instant by instant: forever fused, for
then I shall live, only then shall I live more fully than in
childhood, I shall be as brutal and misshapen as a stone, I
shall be as light and vague as something felt rather than
understood, I shall transcend myself in waves, oh, God, and
may everything come and fall on me, even the
incomprehension of myself at certain blank moments, for I
need only fulfil myself and then nothing will impede my path
until death-without-fear; from whatever struggle or truce, I shall
arise as strong and comely as a young colt.
 
Clarice Lispector
 
 
 
I DEDICATE this narrative to dear old Schumann and his
beloved Clara who are now, alas, nothing but dust and ashes. I
dedicate it to the deep crimson of my blood as someone in his
prime. I dedicate it, above all, to those gnomes, dwarfs, sylphs,
and nymphs who inhabit my life. I dedicate it to the memory
of my years of hardship when everything was more austere
and honourable, and I had never eaten lobster. I dedicate it to
the tempest of Beethoven. To the vibrations of Bach's neutral
colours. To Chopin who leaves me weak. To Stravinsky who
terrifies me and makes me soar in flames. To Death and
Transfiguration
, in which Richard Strauss predicts my fate.
Most of all, I dedicate it to the day's vigil and to day itself, to
the transparent voice of Debussy, to Marios Nobre, to
Prokofiev, to Carl Orff and Schoenberg, to the twelve-tone
composers, to the strident notes of an electronic generation —
to all those musicians who have touched within me the most
alarming and unsuspected regions; to all those prophets of our
age who have revealed me to myself and made me explode
into: me. This me that is you, for I cannot bear to be simply
me, I need others in order to stand up, giddy and awkward
as I am, for what can one do except meditate in order to
plunge into that total void which can only be attained through
meditation. Meditation need not bear fruit: meditation can be
an end in itself. I meditate without words or themes. What
troubles my existence is writing.
And we must never forget that if the atom's structure is
invisible, it is none the less real. I am aware of the existence
of many things I have never seen. And you too. One cannot
prove the existence of what is most real but the essential thing
is to believe. To weep and believe. This story unfolds in a state
of emergency and public calamity. It is an unfinished book
because it offers no answer. An answer I hope someone
somewhere in the world may be able to provide. You perhaps?
It is a story in technicolour to add a touch of luxury, for
heaven knows, I need that too. Amen for all of us.
 
 

 
 
 
 
EVERYTHING in the world began with a yes. One molecule
said yes to another molecule and life was born. But before
prehistory there was the prehistory of prehistory and there was
the never and there was the yes. It was ever so. I do not
know why, but I do know that the universe never began.
Let no one be mistaken. I only achieve simplicity with
enormous effort.
So long as I have questions to which there are no answers, I
shall go on writing. How does one start at the beginning, if
things happen before they actually happen? If before the
pre-prehistory there already existed apocalyptic monsters? If this
history does not exist, it will come to exist. To think is an act.
To feel is a fact. Put the two together — it is me who is
writing what I am writing. God is the world. The truth is
always some inner power without explanation. The more
genuine part of my life is unrecognizable, extremely intimate
and impossible to define. My heart has shed every desire and
reduced itself to one final or initial beat. The toothache that
passes through this narrative has given me a sharp twinge
right in the mouth. I break out into a strident, high-pitched,
syncopated melody. It is the sound of my own pain, of
someone who carries this world where there is so little
happiness. Happiness? I have never come across a more
foolish word, invented by all those unfortunate girls from
north-eastern Brazil.
I should explain that this story will emerge from a gradual
vision — for the past two and a half years I have slowly
started discovering the whys and the wherefores. It is the
vision of the imminence of. . . of what? Perhaps I shall find
out later. Just as I am writing at the same time as I am being
read. Only I do not start with the ending that would justify the
beginning — as death appears to comment on life — because I
must record the preceding events.
Even as I write this I feel ashamed at pouncing on you with a
narrative that is so open and explicit. A narrative, however,
from which blood surging with life might flow only to coagulate
into lumps of trembling jelly. Will this story become my own
coagulation one day? Who can tell? If there is any truth in it
— and clearly the story is true even though invented -— let
everyone see it reflected in himself for we are all one and the
same person, and he who is not poor in terms of money is
poor in spirit or feeling for he lacks something more precious
than gold — for there are those who do not possess that
essential essence.
How do I know all that is about to follow if it is unfamiliar
and something I have never experienced? In a street in Rio de
Janeiro I caught a glimpse of perdition on the face of a girl
from the North-east. Without mentioning that I myself was
raised as a child in the North-east. Besides, I know about
certain things simply by living. Anyone who lives, knows, even
without knowing that he or she knows. So, dear readers, you
know more than you imagine, however much you may deny it.
I do not intend to write anything complicated, although I am
obliged to use the words that sustain you. The story — I have
decided with an illusion of free will — should have some seven
characters, and obviously I am one of the more important.
I, Rodrigo S.M. A traditional tale for I have no desire to be
modish and invent colloquialisms under the guise of originality.
So I shall attempt, contrary to my normal method, to write a
story with a beginning, a middle, and a 'grand finale' followed
by silence and falling rain.
A story that is patently open and explicit yet holds certain
secrets — starting with one of the book's titles 'As For The
Future', preceded and followed by a full stop. This is no
caprice on my part — hopefully this need for confinement will
ultimately become clear. (The ending is still so vague yet, were
my poverty to permit, I should like it to be grandiose.) If,
instead of a full stop, the title were followed by dotted lines, it
would remain open to every kind of speculation on your part,
however morbid or pitiless. It is true that I, too, feel no pity
for my main character, the girl from the North-east: I want
my story to be cold and impartial. Unlike the reader, I reserve
the right to be devastatingly cold, for this is not simply a
narrative, but above all primary life that breathes, breathes,
breathes. Made of porous material, I shall one day assume the
form of a molecule with its potential explosion of atoms. What I
am writing is something more than mere invention; it is my
duty to relate everything about this girl among thousands of
others like her. It is my duty, however unrewarding, to
confront her with her own existence.
For one has a right to shout.
So, I am shouting.
A simple shout that begs no charity. I know that there are
girls who sell their bodies, their only real possession, in
exchange for a good dinner rather than the usual mortadella
sandwich. But the person whom I am about to describe
scarcely has a body to sell; nobody desires her, she is a
harmless virgin whom nobody needs. It strikes me that I don't
need her either and that what I am writing could be written
by another. Another writer, of course, but it would have to be
a man for a woman would weep her heart out.
There are thousands of girls like this girl from the Northeast to
be found in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, living in bedsitters or
toiling behind counters for all they are worth. They aren't even
aware of the fact that they are superfluous and that nobody
cares a damn about their existence. Few of them ever
complain and as far as I know they never protest, for there is
no one to listen.
I am warming up before making a start, rubbing my hands
together to summon up my courage. I can remember a time
when I used to pray in order to kindle my spirit: movement is
spirit. Prayer was a means of confronting myself in silence
away from the gaze of others. As I prayed I emptied my soul
— and this emptiness is everything that I can ever hope to
possess. Apart from this, there is nothing. But emptiness, too,
has its value and somehow resembles abundance. One way of
obtaining is not to search, one way of possessing is not to ask;
simply to believe that my inner silence is the solution to my —
to my mystery.
It is my intention, as I suggested earlier, to write with ever
greater simplicity. Besides, the material at my disposal is all too
sparse and mundane, I possess few details about my characters
and those details are not very revealing; details that laboriously
stem from me only to return to me; the craft of carpentry.
Remember that, no matter what I write, my basic material is
the word. So this story will consist of words that form phrases
from which there emanates a secret meaning that exceeds both
words and phrases. Like every writer, I am clearly tempted to
use succulent terms: I have at my command magnificent
adjectives, robust nouns, and verbs so agile that they glide
through the atmosphere as they move into action. For surely
words are actions? Yet I have no intention of adorning the
word, for were I to touch the girl's bread, that bread would
turn to gold — and the girl (she is nineteen years old) the girl
would be unable to bite into it, and consequently die of
hunger. So I must express myself simply in order to capture
her delicate and shadowy existence. With humility I confine
myself — without making too much fuss about my humility for
then it would no longer be humility — I confine myself to
narrating the unremarkable adventures of a girl living in a
hostile city. A girl who should have stayed in the backwoods of
Alagoas wearing a cotton dress and avoiding the typewriter, for
she was barely literate and had only received three years of
primary schooling. She was so backward that when she typed
she was obliged to copy out every word slowly, letter by letter.
Her aunt had given her a crash course in typing. As a result,
the girl had acquired some dignity: she was a typist at last,
even though she appeared to have some difficulty in stringing
two consonants together. When she copied out the attractive,
rotund handwriting of the boss, whom she idolized, the word
'designate' became 'desiginate', for that is how she herself
would have pronounced it.
Forgive me if I add something more about myself since my
identity is not very clear, and when I write I am surprised to
find that I possess a destiny. Who has not asked himself at
some time or other: am I a monster or is this what it means
to be a person?
First of all, I must make it clear that this girl does not know
herself apart from the fact that she goes on living aimlessly.
Were she foolish enough to ask herself 'Who am I?', she
would fall flat on her face. For the question 'Who am I?'
creates a need. And how does one satisfy that need? To probe
oneself is to recognize that one is incomplete.
The person of whom I am about to speak is so simple-minded
that she often smiles at other people on the street. No one
acknowledges her smile for they don't even notice her.
Coming back to myself: what I am about to write cannot be
assimilated by minds that expect much and crave sophistication.
For what I am about to express will be quite stark. Although it
may have as its background — even now — the tormented
shadows that haunt my dreams as I sleep tormented at night.
Do not, therefore, expect stars in what follows for nothing will
scintillate. This is opaque material and by its very nature it is
despised by everyone. This story has no melody that could be
rightly termed cantabile. Its rhythm is frequently discordant. It
also contains facts. I have always been enthusiastic about facts
without literature — facts are hard stones and I am much
more interested in action than in meditation. There is no way
of escaping facts.
I ask myself if I should jump ahead in time and sketch out an
ending immediately. As it happens, I have no idea how this
story will end. I also realize that I must proceed step by step
in accordance with a period of time measured in hours: even
animals struggle with time. This, too, is my first condition; to
proceed slowly notwithstanding my impatience to tell you about
this girl.
In writing this story, I shall yield to emotion and I know
perfectly well that every day is one more day stolen from
death. In no sense an intellectual, I write with my body. And
what I write is like a dank haze. The words are sounds
transfused with shadows that intersect unevenly, stalactites,
woven lace, transposed organ music. I can scarcely invoke the
words to describe this pattern, vibrant and rich, morbid and
obscure, its counterpoint the deep bass of sorrow. Allegro con
brio. I shall attempt to extract gold from charcoal. I know that
I am holding up the narrative and playing at ball without a
ball. Is the fact an act? I swear that this book is composed
without words: like a mute photograph. This book is a silence:
an interrogation.
I suspect that this lengthy preamble is intended to conceal the
poverty of my story, for I am apprehensive. Before this typist
entered my life, I was a reasonably contented chap despite my
limited success as a writer. Things were somehow so good that
they were in danger of becoming very bad because what is
fully mature is very close to rotting.
But the idea of transcending my own limits suddenly appealed
to me. This happened when I decided to write about reality,
since reality exceeds me. Whatever one understands by reality.
Will what I am about to narrate sound mushy? It has that
tendency but I am determined to sound dry and severe. At
least what I am writing begs no favours or assistance from
anyone: so-called sorrow is borne with the dignity of an
aristocrat.
It seems that I am changing my style of writing. Not being a
professional writer, I please myself what I write about — and I
must write about this girl from the Northeast otherwise I shall
choke. She points an accusing finger and I can only defend
myself by writing about her. I tend to write with bold, severe
strokes like a painter. I shall struggle with facts as if they were
those impossible stones which I mentioned earlier. How I
should love to hear the pealing of bells in order to work up
some enthusiasm as I decipher reality: to see angels flutter like
transparent wasps around my fevered head, this head that
longs to be ultimately transformed into an object-thing, because
so much more simple.
Is it possible that actions exceed words? As I write — let
things be known by their real names. Each thing is a word.
And when there is no word, it must be invented. This God of
yours who commanded us to invent.
Why do I write? First of all because I have captured the spirit
of the language and at times it is the form that constitutes the
content. I write, therefore, not for the girl from the North-east
but for the much more serious reason of force majeure, or
as they say in formal petitions by 'force of law'.
My strength undoubtedly resides in solitude. I am not afraid of
tempestuous storms or violent gales for I am also the night's
darkness. Even though I cannot bear to hear whistling or
footsteps in the dark. Darkness? It reminds me of a former
girl friend. She was sexually experienced and there was such
darkness inside her body. I have never forgotten her: one
never forgets a person with whom one has slept. The event
remains branded on one's living flesh like a tattoo and all who
witness the stigma take flight in horror.
I now want to speak of the girl from the North-east. It's as
follows: like some vagrant bitch she was guided entirely by her
own remote control. For she had reduced herself to herself.
After successive failures, I have also reduced myself, but I still
want to discover the world and its God.
I should like to add some details about the young girl and
myself; we live exclusively in the present because forever and
eternally it is the day of today, and the day of tomorrow will
be a today. Eternity is the state of things at this very moment.
See how apprehensive I have become since putting down
words about the girl from the North-east. The question is: how
do I write? I can verify that I write by ear, just as I learned
English and French by ear. My antecedents as a writer? I am
a man who possesses more money than those who go hungry,
and this makes me in some ways dishonest. I only lie at the
precise hour of lying. But when I write I do not lie. What
else? Yes, I belong to no social category, marginal as I am.
The upper classes consider me a strange creature, the middle
classes regard me with suspicion, afraid that I might unsettle
them, while the lower classes avoid me.
No, it is not easy to write. It is as hard as breaking rocks.
Sparks and splinters fly like shattered steel.
I am scared of starting. I do not even know the girl's name. It
goes without saying that this story drives me to despair
because it is too straightforward. What I propose to narrate
sounds easy and within everyone's grasp. But its elaboration is
extremely difficult. I must render clear something that is almost
obliterated and can scarcely be deciphered. With stiff,
contaminated fingers I must touch the invisible in its own
squalor.
Of one thing I am certain: this narrative will combine with
something delicate: the creation of an entire human being who
is as much alive as I am. I have taken care of her because
my mandate is simply to reveal her presence so that you may
recognize her on the street, moving ever so cautiously because
of her quivering frailty. And should my narrative turn out to
be sad? Later, I shall almost certainly write something more
cheerful, but why cheerful? Because I, too, am a man of
hosannas and perhaps one day I shall intone praises instead of
the misfortunes of the girl from the North-east.
Meantime, I want to walk naked or in rags; I want to
experience at least once the insipid flavour of the Host. To eat
communion bread will be to taste the world's indifference, and
to immerse myself in nothingness. This will be my courage: to
abandon comforting sentiments from the past.
There is little comfort now. In order to speak about the girl I
mustn't shave for days. I must acquire dark circles under my
eyes from lack of sleep: dozing from sheer exhaustion like a
manual labourer. Also wearing threadbare clothes. I am doing
all this to put myself on the same footing as the girl from the
North-east. Fully aware that I might have to present myself in
a more convincing manner to societies who demand a great
deal from someone who is typing at this very moment.
Yes, all this, for history is history. But knowing beforehand so
as never to forget that the word is the fruit of the word. The
word must resemble the word. To attain the word is my first
duty to myself. The word must not be adorned and become
aesthetically worthless; it must be simply itself. It is also true
that I have attempted to acquire a certain refinement of feeling
and that this extreme refinement should not break into a
perpetual line. At the same time, I have attempted to imitate
the deep, raw, dense sound of the trombone, for no good
reason except that I feel so nervous about writing that I might
explode into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. I want to accept
my freedom without reaching the conclusion like so many
others: that existence is only for fools and lunatics: for it would
seem that to exist is illogical.
The action of this story will result in my transfiguration into
someone else and in my ultimate materialization into an object.
Perhaps I might even acquire the sweet tones of the flute and
become entwined in a creeper vine.
But let us return to today. As is known, today is today. No
one understands my meaning and I can obscurely hear
mocking laughter with that rapid, edgy cackling of old men. I
also hear measured footsteps in the road. I tremble with fear.
Just as well that what I am about to write is already written
deep inside me. I must reproduce myself with the delicacy of a
white butterfly. This idea of the white butterfly stems from the
feeling that, should the girl marry, she will marry looking as
slender and ethereal as any virgin dressed in white. Perhaps
she will not marry? To be frank, I am holding her destiny in
my hands and yet I am powerless to invent with any freedom:
I follow a secret, fatal line. I am forced to seek a truth that
transcends me. Why should I write about a young girl whose
poverty is so evident? Perhaps because within her there is
seclusion. Also because in her poverty of body and soul one
touches sanctity and I long to feel the breath of life hereafter.
In order to become greater than I am, for I am so little. I
write because I have nothing better to do in this world: I am
superfluous and last in the world of men. I write because I am
desperate and weary. I can no longer bear the routine of my
existence and, were it not for the constant novelty of writing, I
should die symbolically each day. Yet I am prepared to leave
quietly by the back door. I have experienced almost everything,
even passion and despair. Now I only wish to possess what
might have been but never was.
I seem to know the most intimate details about this girl from
the North-east because I live with her. And since I have
discovered almost everything about her, she has clung to my
skin like some viscous glue or contaminating mud. When I was
a child, I read the story of the old man who was afraid to
cross the river. Whereupon a youth appeared who also wished
to cross to the other side. The old man seized the opportunity
and begged him:
— Please take me with you. You can carry me on your back.
The youth agreed and once they were safely across he said to
the old man:
— We've arrived. You can get down now.
But the old man, who was very sly and astute, replied:
— Oh no! It's so comfortable up here that I intend to stay
put!
The typist doesn't want to get off my back. I now realize that
poverty is both ugly and promiscuous. That's why I cannot say
whether my narrative will be — will be what? I can reveal
nothing for I still haven't worked up enough enthusiasm to
write the story. Will there be a plot? Yes, there will. But what
plot? That, too, I cannot reveal. I am not trying to cause
anguished and voracious expectancy: I simply do not know
what awaits me. I have a restless character on my hands who
escapes me at every turn and expects me to retrieve her.
I forgot to mention that everything I am now writing is
accompanied by the emphatic ruffle of a military drum. The
moment I start to tell my story — the noise of the drum will
suddenly cease.
I see the girl from the North-east looking in the mirror and —
the ruffle of a drum — in the mirror there appears my own
face, weary and unshaven. We have reversed roles so
completely. Without a shadow of doubt she is a physical
person. And what is more: she is a girl who has never seen
her naked body because she is much too embarrassed.
Embarrassed because she is a prude or because she is ugly? I
ask myself how I am going to cope with so many facts without
coming to grief. The figurative suddenly appeals to me. I create
human action and tremble. Suddenly I crave the figurative like
the painter who only uses abstract colours but wants to prove
that he does so deliberately and not because he has no talent
for drawing. In order to draw the girl, I must control my
emotions. In order to capture her soul, I must nourish myself
frugally on fruit and drink chilled white wine because it is
stifling in this cubby-hole where I have locked myself away and
where I feel a sudden urge to see the world. I've also had to
give up sex and football. And avoid all human contact. Shall I
go back one day to my former way of life? I seriously doubt
it. I should also mention that I read nothing these days for
fear that I might adulterate the simplicity of my language with
useless refinements. For as I explained, the word is my
instrument and must resemble the word. Or am I not a
writer? More actor than writer, for with only one system of
punctuation at my disposal, I juggle with intonation and force
another's breathing to accompany my text.
I forgot to mention that the record that is about to begin —
for I can no longer bear the onslaught of facts — the record
that is about to begin is written under the sponsorship of the
most popular soft drink in the world even though it does not
earn me anything; a soft drink that is distributed throughout
the world. It is the same soft drink that sponsored the recent
earthquake in Guatemala. Despite the fact that it tastes of nail
polish, toilet soap and chewed plastic. None of this prevents
people from loving it with servility and subservience. Also
because — and I am now going to say something strange that
only I can understand — this drink which contains coca is
today. It allows people to be modern and to move with the
times.
As for the girl, she exists in an impersonal limbo, untouched
by what is worst or best. She merely exists, inhaling and
exhaling, inhaling and exhaling. Why should there be anything
more? Her existence is sparse. Certainly. But why should I feel
guilty? Why should I try to relieve myself of the burden of not
having done anything concrete to help the girl? This girl — I
see that I have almost started telling my story — this girl who
slept in cheap cotton underwear with faint but rather suspicious
bloodstains. In an effort to fall asleep on cold wintry nights, she
would curl up into a ball, receiving and giving out her own
scant warmth. She slept with her mouth wide open because of
her stuffed-up nostrils, dead to the world from sheer
exhaustion.
I must add one important detail to help the reader understand
the narrative: it is accompanied from start to finish by the
faintest yet nagging twinge of toothache, caused by an exposed
nerve. The story will also be accompanied throughout by the
plangent tones of a violin played by a musician on the street
corner. His face is thin and sallow as if he had just died.
Perhaps he is dead. I have explained these details at great
length for fear of having promised too much and offering too
little. My story is almost trivial. The trick is to begin suddenly,
like plunging into an icy sea and bearing its intense coldness
with suicidal courage. I am about to begin in the middle by
telling you that —
— that she was inept. Inept for living. She had no idea how to
cope with life and she was only vaguely aware of her own
inner emptiness. Were she capable of explaining herself, she
might well confide: the world stands outside me. I stand outside
myself. (It's going to be difficult to tell this story. Even though
I have nothing to do with the girl, I shall have to write
everything through her, trapped as I am by my own fears.
The facts are sonorous but among the facts there is a
murmuring. It is the murmuring that frightens me.)
The girl had no way of coping. So much so, (bang) that she
made no protest when the boss of her firm which distributed
pulley equipment bluntly warned her (a blunt-ness she seemed
to provoke with that foolish expression on her face as if
begging to be slapped) that he was only prepared to keep on
her workmate Glória. He told her he was fed up with her
typing mistakes and those blots she invariably made on the
paper. The girl felt that she ought to say something to show
respect for this boss with whom she was secretly infatuated.
— Please forgive all the trouble I've caused. Senhor Raimundo
Silveira, who had already turned his back on her, looked round
surprised by the girl's politeness, and something in her docile
expression forced him to speak less harshly, and grudgingly
concede:
— Well, you needn't leave right away. Let's see how things
work out.
After receiving this warning, the girl went to the lavatory where
she could be alone, for she felt quite shaken. She examined
herself mechanically in the mirror above the filthy hand basin
that was badly cracked and full of hairs: the image of her own
existence. The dark, tarnished mirror scarcely reflected any
image. Perhaps her physical existence had vanished? This
illusion soon passed and she saw her entire face distorted by
the tarnished mirror; her nose had grown as huge as those
false noses made of papier maché donned by circus clowns.
She studied herself and mused: so young and yet so tarnished.
(There are those who have. And there are those who have
not. It's very simple: the girl had not. Hadn't what? Simply
this: she had not. If you get my meaning that's fine. If you
don't, it's still fine. But why am I bothering about this girl
when what I really want is wheat that turns ripe and golden in
summer?)
When she was a little girl, her aunt, in order to frighten her,
insisted that the vampire — the one that sucks human blood
by biting its victims in the flesh of the neck — casts no
reflection in the mirror. She reckoned that it might not be such
a bad thing being a vampire, for the blood would add a touch
of pink to her sallow complexion. For she gave the impression
of having no blood unless a day might come when she would
have to spill it.
The girl had drooping shoulders like those of a darning-woman.
She had learned to darn as a child, and she might have made
more of her life had she devoted herself to the delicate task of
mending, perhaps even with silken threads. Or even more
luxurious: shiny satin, a kiss of souls. The darning-needle
turned mosquito. A granule of sugar carried on an ant's back.
She was as light-headed as an idiot, only she was no idiot.
She wasn't even aware that she was unhappy. The one thing
she had was faith. In what? In you? It isn't necessary to have
faith in anyone or in anything — it is enough to have faith.
This often endowed her with a state of grace. For she had
never lost faith.
(The girl worries me so much that I feel drained. She has
drained me empty. And the less she demands, the more she
worries me. I feel frustrated and annoyed. A raging desire to
smash dishes and break windows. How can I avenge myself?
Or rather, how can I get satisfaction? I've found the answer:
by loving my dog that consumes more food than she does.
Why does she not fight back? Has she no pluck? No, she is
sweet and docile.)
Her eyes were enormous, round, bulging and inquisitive — she
had the expression of someone with a broken wing— some
deficiency of the thyroid gland — questioning eyes. Whom was
she questioning? God? She did not think about God, nor did
God think about her. God belongs to those who succeed in
pinning Him down. God appears in a moment of distraction.
She asked no questions. She divined that there were no
answers. Was she foolish enough to ask? Only to get a blunt
no in reply? Perhaps she thought about this futile question so
that no one could ever accuse her one day of never having
asked. Not knowing who to turn to, she appeared to have
answered her own question: it is so because it is so. Could
there be some other answer? If anyone knows of a better one,
let him speak up for I have been waiting for years.
Meanwhile, the clouds are white and the sky is blue. Why is
there so much God? At the expense of men.
She had been born with a legacy of misfortune, a creature
from nowhere with the expression of someone who apologizes
for occupying too much space. Lost in thought, she examined
the blotches on her face in the mirror. In Alagoas they had a
special name for this condition — it was commonly believed to
be caused by the liver. The girl concealed her blotches with a
thick layer of white powder which gave the impression that she
had been whitewashed but it was preferable to looking sallow.
Her general appearance was grimy for she rarely washed.
During the day she wore a blouse and skirt, at night she slept
in her underwear. Her room-mates didn't have the courage to
tell her about her stale body odour. And since she herself
seemed to be oblivious of the fact, they were afraid of hurting
her feelings. There was nothing irridescent about her, although
the parts of her skin unaffected by the blotches had the subtle
glow of opals. Not that it mattered. No one paid any attention
to her on the street, for she was as appetizing as cold coffee.
And so her days passed. The girl blew her nose on the hem
of her petticoat. She lacked that elusive quality known as
charm. I am the only person who finds her charming. As the
author, I alone love her. I suffer on her account. And I alone
may say to her: 'What do you ask of me weeping, that I
would not give you singing?' The girl did not know that she
existed, just as a dog doesn't know that it's a dog. Therefore
she wasn't aware of her own unhappiness. The only thing she
desired was to live. She could not explain, for she didn't probe
her situation. Perhaps she felt there was some glory in living.
She thought that a person was obliged to be happy. So she
was happy. Before being born was she an idea? Before being
born was she dead? And after being born was she about to
die? What a thin slice of water melon.
There are few facts to relate and I am still not sure how this
story will develop.
Now (bang) with a few rapid strokes I shall delineate the girl's
previous history up to the moment when she stood before the
mirror in the lavatory.
She was hopelessly rachitic at birth, the inheritance of the
backwoods — the legacy of misfortune I mentioned earlier.
When she was two years old, her parents died of typhoid fever
in the backwoods of Alagoas, in that region where the devil is
said to have lost his boots. Much later she went to live in
Maceió with her maiden aunt, a sanctimonious spinster, and
the girl's only surviving relative in the whole wide world. On
occasion the girl would recall some incident from her time
there. For instance, her aunt rapping her on the head because
the old woman believed that the crown of the head was the
vital part of one's body. Her aunt would use her knuckles to
rap that head of skin and bones which suffered from a
calcium deficiency. She would thrash the girl not only because
she derived some sensuous pleasure from thrashing her — the
old girl found the idea of sexual intercourse so disgusting that
she had never married — but also because she considered it
her duty to see that the girl did not finish up like many
another girl in Maceió standing on street corners with a lit
cigarette waiting to pick up a man. So far the girl had shown
no signs of becoming a prostitute one day. Even puberty
seemed alien to her destiny. Puberty was slow in coming but
even among weeds there exists a need for sunlight. The girl
soon forgot those thrashings. If you wait patiently, the pain
soon passes. But what pained her more was to be denied her
favourite dessert: guava preserve with cheese, the only real
passion in her life. Her sly old aunt enjoyed punishing her in
this way. The girl didn't dare ask why she was always being
punished. One doesn't have to know everything and not
knowing became an important factor in her life.
Not knowing sounds awful, but it was not so awful for the girl
knew lots of things just as a dog knows how to wag its tail or
a beggar how to feel hungry: things happen and you suddenly
know. No one would teach her how to die one day: yet one
day she would surely die as if she had already learned by
heart how to play the starring role. For at the hour of death
you become a celebrated film star, it is a moment of glory for
everyone, when the choral music scales the top notes.
When she was tiny, the girl dearly longed to possess a pet
animal. Her aunt, however, decided that an animal in the
house would simply mean one more mouth to feed. The girl
resigned herself, convinced that she was only fit for breeding
fleas and that she didn't deserve a dog's affection. Her aunt's
constant reproaches had taught her to keep her head lowered.
The old girl's sanctimonious ways, however, had failed to
influence her. Once her aunt was dead, the girl never again set
foot inside a church. She had no religious feeling and the
divinities made no impression.
Life is like that: you press a button and life lights up. Except
that the girl didn't know which button to press. She wasn't
even aware that she lived in a technological society where she
was a mere cog in the machine. One thing, however, did
worry her: she no longer knew if she had ever had a father
or mother. She had forgotten her origins. If she had thought
hard, she might have concluded that she had sprouted from
the soil of Alagoas inside a mushroom that soon rotted. She
could speak, of course, but had little to say. No sooner do I
succeed in persuading her to speak, than she slips through my
fingers.
Notwithstanding her aunt's death, the girl was certain that for
her things would be different. She would never die. (It's my
obsession to become the other man. In this case, the other
woman. Pale and feeling weak, I tremble just like her.)
The definable is making me a little weary. I prefer truths that
carry no prophecies. When I eventually rid myself of this story,
I shall withdraw to the more arbitrary realm of vague
prophecies. I did not invent this girl. She forced her being
upon me. She was by no means mentally retarded: she was
as helpless and trusting as any fool. At least the girl didn't
have to beg for food. (There were others who were even more
abandoned and starving.) I alone love her.
Then — who knows for what reason — she arrived in Rio, the
incredible Rio de Janeiro, where her aunt had found her a
job. Then her aunt had died, and the girl was on her own,
lodging in a bedsitter with four other girls who worked as
shop-assistants at a well-known department store.
The bedsitter was in an old, colonial-style tenement in Acre
Street, a red-light district near the docks inhabited by women
who picked up seamen in the streets between the depots of
charcoal and cement. Those polluted docks made the girl yearn
for some future. (What's happening? It's as if I were listening
to a lively tune being played on the piano — a sign perhaps
that the girl will have a brilliant future? I am consoled by this
possibility and will do everything in my power to make it come
to pass.)
Acre Street. What a slum. The plump rats of Acre Street. I
keep well away from the place. To be frank, I am terrified of
that dark hole and its depraved inhabitants.
From time to time, the girl was lucky enough to hear a
cockerel welcome the dawn. Then she would remember the
backwoods of Alagoas with nostalgia. Where could there be
room for a cockerel to crow in that warren of warehouses
storing goods for export and import? (If the reader is
financially secure and enjoys the comforts of life, he must step
out of himself and see how others live. If he is poor, he will
not be reading this story because what I have to say is
superfluous for anyone who often feels the pangs of hunger.
Here I am acting as a safety-valve for you and the tedious
bourgeoisie. I know that it is very frightening to step out of
oneself, but then everything which is unfamiliar can be
frightening. The anonymous girl of this story is so ancient that
she could be described as biblical. She was subterranean and
had never really flowered. I am telling a lie: she was wild
grass.)
Throughout the torrid summers, the oppressive heat of Acre
Street made her sweat, a sweat that gave off an appalling
stench. A sweat, I couldn't help feeling, that stemmed from
sinister origins. Difficult to say if the girl was tubercular. I
rather think not. In the night shadows a man was whistling;
there were heavy footsteps and the howling of an abandoned
mongrel. There were silent constellations, and that space known
as time which has nothing to do with her or with us. And so
the days passed. The cockerel's crowing in the blood-red dawn
gave a new meaning to her withered existence. As day broke,
a flock of birds chirped noisily in Acre Street: life sprouted
from the ground, jubilant between the paving stones.
Acre Street for living, Lavradio Street for working, the docks
for excursions on Sundays. Now and then the lingering sound
of a cargo ship's signal that strangely made the heart beat
faster, and in between each signal, the consoling though
somewhat melancholy cries of the cockerel.
The cockerel belonged to the never-never land. Its cries came
from the infinite right up to her bedside, filling her with
gratitude. She slept lightly. For the past twelve months she had
been suffering from a persistent cold. In the early hours each
morning, she was seized by a fit of hoarse coughing, which
she tried to smother with her limp pillow. Her room-mates —
Maria da Penha, Maria Aparecida, Maria José and plain Maria
— paid no attention. They were too exhausted to complain,
worn out by an occupation that was no less taxing simply
because it was anonymous. One of the girls sold Coty face
powder. What a curious occupation! They turned on to their
other sides and went back to sleep. The girl's coughing actually
lulled them into an even deeper sleep. Is the sky above or
below? The girl from the North-east was wondering. As she lay
there, she couldn't decide. Sometimes before falling asleep she
felt the pangs of hunger and became quite giddy as she
visualized a side of beef. The solution was to chew paper into
pulp and swallow it. Honestly! I'm getting used to her but I
still feel uneasy. Dear God! I feel happier with animals than
with people. When I watch my horse cantering freely across
the fields— I am tempted to put my head against his soft,
vigorous neck and narrate the story of my life. When I stroke
my dog on the head — I know that he doesn't expect me to
make sense or explain myself.
Perhaps the girl from the North-east has already come to the
conclusion that life is troublesome, a soul that doesn't quite
match its body, even a delicate soul like hers. Being very
superstitious, the girl imagined that if she should ever begin to
enjoy life, the spell would be broken. She would cease to be a
princess and become transformed into an insect. Because,
however awful her situation might be, she had no wish to be
deprived of herself. She wanted to be herself. She feared that
she would incur some terrible punishment and even be
sentenced to death if she began to experience pleasure. So she
shielded herself from death by living below par, by consuming
her life sparingly so that it shouldn't come to an abrupt
ending. This economy provided some reassurance, for the
person who falls can only hit the floor. Did she feel that she
had nothing to live for? I have no way of knowing, but I think
not. Only once did she ask herself that traumatic question:
Who am I? The question frightened her to such an extent that
her mind became paralysed. I feel, without becoming her, that I
have nothing to live for. I am gratuitous, and I pay my bills
for electricity, gas and telephone. As for the girl, she would
sometimes buy a rose when the boss paid out her wages.
These events belong to the present and I shall only finish this
awkward narrative when I am too exhausted to struggle any
longer. I am no deserter.
Sometimes the girl remembered the disturbing words of a
French ballad. She had heard it sung out of tune by a group
of young girls who danced in a circle, joining hands — she
had listened without being able to participate because her aunt
was calling her to come and sweep the floor. With their, long,
wavy hair in pink ribbons, the girls sang: 'Give me one of
your daughters . . . maré-marré-deci.' 'I chose your daughter .
. . maré-marré.' A pale spectre, the music hovered like a rose
of reckless beauty. Yet transient. Pale and transient, the girl
was now the sweet and horrifying spectre of a childhood
without games or dolls. At such moments, she would pretend
that she was running along corridors clutching a doll to her
chest and chasing a ball with much laughter and amusement.
Her laughter was terrifying because it belonged to the past and
it was only revived by a malign imagination, a yearning for
what might have been but never was. (I gave you fair warning
that this is what is known as popular literature despite my
reluctance to betray any emotion.)
It must be said that the girl is not conscious of my presence.
Were it otherwise, she would have someone to pray for and
that would mean salvation. But I am fully conscious of her
presence: through her I utter my cry of horror to existence.
To this existence I love so dearly.
To return to the girl: the one luxury she permitted herself was
a few sips of cold coffee before going to bed. She paid for this
luxury by waking up with heartburn.
She rarely spoke (having little or nothing to say) but she loved
sounds. Sounds were life. The night's silence made her feel
nervous. It was as if night were about to pronounce some fatal
word. At night, cars seldom passed through Acre Street. When
they did, the louder their horns the more she liked it. As if
these fears were not enough, she was also terrified of catching
some dreadful disease down below — that was something her
aunt had taught her. Although her tiny ovules were all
shrivelled. So hopelessly shrivelled. Her life was so monotonous
that by the end of the day she could no longer remember
what had happened that same morning. She mused in silence
and the thought came to her: since I am, the solution is to be.
The cockerel I mentioned earlier heralded yet another day. It
sang of weariness. Speaking of poultry, the girl sometimes ate a
hard-boiled egg in a snackbar. Her aunt had always insisted
that eggs were bad for the liver. That being so, she obediently
became ill and suffered pains on the left side opposite the liver.
For the girl was most impressionable. She believed in
everything that existed and in everything non-existent as well.
But she didn't know how to embellish reality. For her, reality
was too enormous to grasp. Besides, the word reality meant
nothing to her. Nor to me, dear God.
As she slept, she often dreamed that her aunt was rapping
her on the head. More surprisingly, she often dreamed about
sex, she, who to all appearances was completely asexual. When
she finally woke up, she was overcome by feelings of guilt
without being able to explain why. Perhaps because everything
that is pleasurable should be forbidden. Guilty and contented.
Her doubts confirmed her sense of guilt and she mechanically
recited three Hail Marys, Amen, Amen, Amen. She prayed but
without God. She did not know Him, therefore He did not
exist.
Leaving God aside, I have just discovered that reality made
little sense to the girl. She felt much more at ease with the
unreality of everyday life. She lived in slo-o-ow motion, a hare
le-e-eaping through the a-a-air over hi— i— ill and da-a-ale,
obscurity was her earth, obscurity was the inner core of
nature.
She found consolation in being sad. Not desperate, for she was
much too modest and simple to indulge in despair, but that
indefinable quality associated with romantics. It goes without
saying that she was neurotic. Neurosis sustained her. Dear
God, neurosis counted for something: almost as good as
crutches. Occasionally she wandered into the more fashionable
quarters of the city and stood gazing at the shop windows
displaying glittering jewels and luxurious garments in satin and
silk — just to mortify the senses. The truth is that she needed
to find herself and a little mortification helped.
On Sundays, she always woke up early in order to be able to
spend more time doing absolutely nothing. The worst moment
of all was late on Sunday afternoons when she would lapse
into anxious meditation, the emptiness of barren Sunday. She
sighed. She recalled her childhood with nostalgia — dried
mandioca — and believed that she had been happy. In truth,
no matter how bad one's childhood may have been, it always
sounds enchanted in recollection — how awful. The girl never
complained about anything. She accepted things as they are —
after all, who was responsible for organizing the land inhabited
by men? Surely one day she would gain a place in the
paradise reserved for misfits. Besides, in her case it simply isn't
a question of gaining Paradise. She is a misfit even in this
world. I swear that nothing can be done for her. Believe me, I
would help her if I could. I realize that in saying that my typist
has a diseased body, I am saying something much more
offensive than any obscenity.
(It's as good as saying that a healthy dog is worth more.)
At this point, I must record one happy event. One distressing
Sunday without mandioca, the girl experienced a strange
happiness: at the quayside, she saw a rainbow. She felt
something close to ecstasy and tried to retain the vision: if only
she could see once more the display of fireworks she had seen
as a child in Maceió. She wanted more, for it is true that
when one extends a helping hand to the lower orders, they
want everything else; the man on the street dreams greedily of
having everything. He has no right to anything but wants
everything. Wouldn't you agree? There were no means within
my power to produce that golden rain achieved with fireworks.
Should I divulge that she adored soldiers? She was mad about
them. Whenever she caught sight of a soldier, she would think,
trembling with excitement: is he going to murder me?
If the girl only knew that my own happiness stems from the
deepest sorrow and that sorrow is an abortive form of
happiness. Certainly, she was a contented creature despite the
neurosis. The neurosis of battle.
Apart from her monthly visit to the cinema, she enjoyed
another luxury. She lacquered her nails a bright scarlet.
Unfortunately, she had bitten her nails to such an extent that
most of the lacquer had disappeared, revealing the grime
underneath.
And when she woke up? When she woke up, she no longer
knew her own identity. Only later did she reflect with
satisfaction: I am a typist and a virgin, and I like coca-cola.
Only then did she get dressed, and spend the rest of the day
passively enacting the role of being.
Perhaps I could enhance this story if I were to introduce some
difficult technical terms? But that is the problem: this story has
no technique, not even in matters of style. It has been written
at random. Nothing would persuade me to contaminate with
brilliant, mendacious words, a life as frugal as that of my typist.
During the day, like everyone else, I make gestures that are
unobserved even by me. One of my most unobserved gestures
is this story, which comes out as it will, independent of me.
The typist lived in a kind of limbo, hovering between heaven
and hell. She had never given any thought to the concept: 'I
am, therefore, I am.' I suspect that she felt she had no right
to do so, being a mere accident of nature. A foetus wrapped
up in newspaper and thrown on to a rubbish dump. Are there
thousands of others like her? Yes, thousands of others who are
mere accidents of nature. And if one thinks about it carefully,
aren't we all mere accidents of nature? I have only escaped
from a similar fate because I am a writer. Any action is also a
fact. When I make contact with my spiritual forces, I find your
God within myself. Why do I write? Can I explain? I simply
don't know. In fact, I sometimes think that I am not me. I
seem to belong to a remote planet, I am such a stranger unto
myself. Can this be me? I am horrified by this encounter with
myself.
As I've already said, the girl from the North-east did not
believe in death. She couldn't believe in death — after all —
was she not alive? She had long since forgotten the names of
her father and mother, for her aunt had never mentioned
them. (I am exploiting the written word with the utmost ease.
This alarms me, for I am afraid of losing my sense of order
and of plunging into an abyss resounding with cries and
shrieks: the Hell of human freedom. But I shall continue.)
To continue:
Every morning she switched on the transistor radio loaned by
one of her room-mates, Maria da Penha. She switched it on as
low as possible so as not to disturb the others, and she
invariably tuned into Radio Clock, a channel that broadcast the
correct time and educational programmes.
There was no music, only a constant ping like drops of falling
rain — a drop for every minute that passed. This channel took
advantage of the pauses between each ping to broadcast
commercials. She adored commercials.
It was the ideal programme for between each ping the
announcer gave snippets of information that one day might
stand her in good stead. This was how the girl learned, for
example, that the Emperor Charlemagne was known as Carolus
in his native land. Admittedly, she had never had any
opportunity to make use of this information. But you never
know. Patience always pays off in the end. Listening to the
same programme, she also learned that the only animal that
doesn't crossbreed with its own offspring, is the horse.
— That's filth! she muttered to the transistor radio.
On another occasion, she heard the message: 'Repent in Christ
and He will give you great joy.' So she decided to repent. Not
quite knowing what she had to repent of, the girl from the
North-east repented of everything. The preacher added that
vengeance is a deadly sin. So she sought no revenge.
Yes, patience always pays off in the end. Seriously? The girl
possessed what is known as inner life without knowing that she
possessed it. She was nourished by her own entity, as if she
were feeding off her own entrails. When she travelled to work,
she behaved like a harmless lunatic. As the bus sped along,
she daydreamed aloud and voiced the most extravagant
dreams. Her dreams were empty on account of all that inner
life, because they lacked the essential nucleus of any prior
experience of— of ecstasy, let's say. Most of the time, she
possessed, without knowing it, the emptiness that replenishes
the souls of saints. Was she a saint? It would seem so. The
girl didn't know that she was meditating, for the word
meditation was unknown to her. I get the impression that her
life was one long meditation about nothingness. Except that she
needed others in order to believe in herself, otherwise she
would become lost in the continuous, spiralling vacuum inside
her. She tended to meditate while she typed, and this caused
her to make even more mistakes than usual.
She indulged in certain little pleasures. On wintry nights,
shivering from head to foot under a thin cotton sheet, she
would read by candle-light the advertisements that she had cut
out of old newspapers lying around the office. She collected
newspaper advertisements, and pasted them into an album. The
advertisement she treasured most of all was in colour: it
advertised a face cream for women with complexions so very
different from her own sallow skin. Blinking furiously (a fatal tic
that she had recently acquired), she imagined the pleasure of
possessing such luxuries. The cream looked so appetizing that,
were she to find enough money to buy it, she wouldn't be
foolish. Never mind her skin! She would eat the cream, she
would, in large spoonfuls straight from the jar. She was
needing to put on some flesh, for her body was drier than a
half-empty sack of toasted breadcrumbs. With time, she had
become transformed into mere living matter in its primary state.
Perhaps this was her protection from the enormous temptation
to be unhappy and to feel sorry for herself. (When I consider
that I might have been born her — and why not? — I
shudder. The fact that I am not her strikes me as being a
cowardly escape. I feel remorse, as I explained in one of my
titles for this book.)
In any case, the future looked brighter. The future, at least,
had the advantage of not being the present, and the worse
can always take a turn for the better. There wasn't a trace of
human misery in the girl. She carried within her an aura of
innocence. For, strange though it may seem, she had faith.
Composed of fine organic matter, she existed. Pure and simple.
And what about me? The only thing that can be said about
me is that I am breathing.
Even though all she possessed within was that tiny essential
flame: the breath of life. (I am having a hellish time with this
story. May the Gods never decree that I should write about a
leper, for then I should become covered in leprosy.) (I am
delaying the events that I can vaguely foresee, simply because I
need to make several portraits of this girl from Alagoas. Also
because if anyone should read this story, I'd like them to
absorb this young woman like a cloth soaked in water. The girl
embodies a truth I was anxious to avoid. I don't know whom
I can blame, but someone is to blame.)
Is it possible that in penetrating the seeds of her existence, I
am violating the secrets of the Pharaohs?
Will I be condemned to death for discussing a life that
contains, like the lives of all of us, an inviolable secret? I am
desperately trying to discover in the girl's existence at least one
bright topaz. Perhaps I shall succeed before finishing my story.
It's much too early to say, but I am hopeful.
I forgot to mention that sometimes this typist is nauseated by
the thought of food. This dates from her childhood when she
discovered that she had eaten a fried cat. The thought revolted
her for ever more. She lost her appetite and felt the great
hunger thereafter. She was convinced that she had committed
a crime; that she had eaten a fried angel, its wings snapping
between her teeth. She believed in angels, and because she
believed in them, they existed. The girl had never eaten lunch
or dinner in a restaurant. She ate her food standing at the
snack-bar on the street corner. She fancied that a woman who
enters a restaurant must be French and on the loose.
There were certain words whose meaning escaped her. One
such word was ephemeris. For didn't Senhor Raimundo ask
her to copy from his elegant handwriting the word ephemeris
or ephemerides? She found the word ephemerides altogether
mysterious. When she copied the word out she paused over
each letter. Her workmate Glória could do shorthand and, not
only did she earn more, but she even seemed unperturbed by
those difficult words that the boss was so fond of using.
Meanwhile, the girl became enamoured of the word ephemeris.
Another portrait: she had never received gifts from anyone. It
didn't worry her for she needed so little. One day, however,
she saw something that, for one brief moment, she dearly
wanted: it was a book that Senhor Raimundo, who was fond
of literature, had left on the table. The book was entitled The
Shamed and Oppressed. The girl remained pensive. Perhaps
for the very first time she had established her social class. She
thought and thought and thought! She decided that no one
had ever really oppressed her and that everything that
happened to her was inevitable. It was futile trying to struggle.
Why struggle? I ask myself: will she one day experience love
and its farewell? Will she one day experience love and its
deceptions? Will she experience love's rapture in her own
modest way? Who can tell? How can one disguise the simple
fact that the entire world is somewhat sad and lonely? The girl
from the North-east was lost in the crowd. She caught the bus
in Maua Square. It was bitterly cold and she had no warm
clothing to protect her from the wind. But there were the
cargo ships that filled her with yearning for who knows what.
This happened only on the rare occasion. Most of the time she
walked out of her gloomy office into the fading light, and noted
that every day at the same hour, it was exactly the same
hour. Nothing could be done about the great clock that
marked time within time. Yes, to my exasperation, the same
hour. Well, so what? So nothing! Speaking for myself, the
author of this human character, I cannot stand repetition:
routine divides me from potential novelties within my reach.
Speaking of novelties, one day the girl saw a man in a
snack-bar who was so amazingly good-looking that she would
have loved to take him home. It would be like— like possessing
a large emerald — emerald — emerald displayed in a jewel
box. Forbidden to touch. The ring on his finger suggested that
he was married. How could one marry — marry — marry a
man who was only meant to be seen — seen — seen, she
stammered in her mind. She would die of shame were she to
eat in his presence, for he was much too good-looking by far.
It occurred to her that she would like to rest her back for just
a day. She knew that if she spoke to her boss, he would
refuse to believe that her ribs were aching. So she had
recourse to a lie that sounded much more convincing than the
truth: she informed her boss that she would be unable to turn
up for work the following day because she had to have a
tooth extracted that might be troublesome. The lie worked.
Sometimes only a lie can save you. The following day,
therefore, when the four weary Marias set off for work, she
could enjoy at long last the greatest privilege of all: solitude.
She had the room all to herself. The girl could scarcely believe
that all this space was hers to enjoy. It was so quiet you could
have heard a pin drop. Overcome with joy at her good
fortune, the girl danced with reckless abandon. Her aunt would
never have tolerated this behaviour. She danced and waltzed
round the room for solitude made her: f-r-e-e! She took full
advantage of this well-earned solitude, of the transistor radio
which she played at full volume, of the room's spaciousness
once vacated by the four Marias. She begged some instant
coffee as a special favour from the landlady, then as an
additional favour, she also asked for some boiling water. As she
drank, licking her lips between each sip, she studied her own
enjoyment in the mirror. To confront herself was a pleasure
that she had never before experienced. I have never been so
happy in my whole life, she thought. She owed nothing to
anyone, and no one owed her anything. She even indulged in
the luxury of feeling a little weary — a weariness quite unlike
the usual weariness.
I am a little suspicious of this sudden ease with which the girl
is asking favours. Perhaps she needed special conditions in
order to become appealing. Why hadn't she always behaved
like this? Even looking at herself in the mirror was no longer
quite so alarming: she was contented but how it ached.
— Ah, merry month of May, abandon me no more! (Bang)
she exclaimed inwardly the following morning, the seventh of
May, she who never exclaimed anything. Probably because she
had finally been given something. Given to her by herself, but
nevertheless given.
On the morning of the seventh of May, an unforeseen ecstasy
gripped her tiny body. The bright, open light from the streets
penetrated her opacity. May, the month of bridal veils floating
in clouds of white.
What follows is merely an attempt to reproduce three pages
which I had already written. My cook, seeing them lying
around, threw them into the wastepaper-basket to my utter
despair — let the souls in Purgatory assist me to bear the
almost unbearable, for the living are not much good to me.
This tentative reconstruction is nothing like my original version
of the girl's meeting with her future boy friend. Abashed, I
shall try to relate the story of the story. But if anyone asks me
how it came about, I shall reply: I simply do not know. I've
lost the thread of my plot.
May, the month of brides, transformed into butterflies floating
in white tulle. Her exclamations could have been a premonition
of what was about to occur in the late afternoon of that same
day. In a downpour of rain, she met (bang) the first
boy-friend of any kind she had ever known, her heart beating
furiously as if she had swallowed a little bird that continued to
flutter inside her. The boy and the girl stared at each other in
the rain and recognized each other as native North-easterners,
creatures of the same species with that unmistakable aura. She
stared at him, drying her wet face with her hands. The girl
only had to see the youth in order to transform him
immediately into her guava preserve with cheese.
He. . .
He approached her and spoke with the singsong intonation of
the North-easterner that went straight to her heart. He said
— Excuse me, missy, but would you care to come for a walk?
— Yes, she replied in confusion and haste, before he could
change his mind.
— If you don't mind my asking, what's your name?
— Macabéa.
— Maca — what?
— Béa, she was forced to repeat.
— Gosh, it sounds like the name of a disease ... a skin
disease.
— I agree but it's the name my mother gave me because of a
vow she made to Our Lady of Sorrows if I should survive.
For the first year of my life, I wasn't called anything because I
didn't have a name. I'd have preferred to go on being called
nothing instead of having a name that nobody has ever heard
of, yet it seems to suit me — she paused for a moment to
catch her breath before adding shyly and a little downhearted—
for as you can see, I'm still here. . . so that's that.
— Even in the backwoods of Paraíba, fulfilling a vow is a
question of honour.
Neither of them knew much about walking out together. They
walked under the heavy rain and lingered in front of an
ironmongers that boasted a wide selection of metal tubes,
containers, nuts and bolts. Macabéa, afraid that the silence
between them might be a warning of imminent separation,
remarked to her newly-found boy-friend:
— I love nuts and bolts. What about you?
The second time they met, the rain had settled into a steady
drizzle and soaked them to the skin. Without even as much as
holding hands, they walked under the drizzle, the water
streaming like tears down Macabéa's face.
The third time they met - Well now, if it isn't raining? The
youth, suddenly dropping that superficial veneer of politeness
that his stepfather had inculcated with some effort, snapped at
her:
— All you seem to bring is the rain!
— I'm sorry.
She was already so infatuated, however, that she could no
longer do without him in her hunger for love.
On one of the occasions they met, she finally plucked up
enough courage to ask him his name.
— Olímpico de Jesus Moreira Chaves — he lied, because his
real surname was simply Jesus, a clear indication that he was
illegitimate. The youth had been brought up by his stepfather,
who had taught him how to ingratiate himself with people in
order to get his own way and how to pick up girls.
— I don't understand your name — she said.
— Olímpico?
Macabéa pretended to be very inquisitive while concealing the
fact that she had never understood anything the first time
round. Aggressive as a fighting cock, Olímpico bristled at her
foolish questions, to which he could provide no answers. He
retorted impatiently:
— I know what it means, but I'm not telling you!
— That's all right, that's all right, that's all right. . . people
don't have to understand what names mean. She understood
what desire meant — although she didn't know that she
understood. That was how it was: she was starving but not for
food, it was a numb sort of pain that rose from her lower
abdomen, making the nipples of her breast quiver and her
empty arms starved of any embrace came out in
goose-pimples. She became overwrought and it was painful to
live. At such moments, she would shake with nerves and her
workmate Glória would rush to get her a glass of water with
sugar.
Olímpico de Jesus was a metal-worker and Macabéa failed to
notice that he never once referred to himself as a worker but
always as a metallurgist. Macabéa was delighted with his
professional standing just as she was proud of being a typist
even if she did earn less than the minimum salary. She and
Olímpico had social status. 'Metallurgist and typist' were
categories of some distinction. Olímpico's job had the flavour
one tastes when smoking a cigarette the wrong way round. His
job was to collect the metal rods as they came off the machine
and load them on to a conveyor belt. Macabéa never got
round to asking him why the rods were put on a conveyor
belt. He didn't have such a bad life and he even managed to
save some of his wages: he had free shelter at night in a hut
that was due for demolition because of his friendship with the
night watchman. Macabéa observed:
— Good manners are the best thing one can inherit.
— As far as I'm concerned, the best inheritance is plenty of
money. One day, I'll be a rich man — he rejoined grandly,
convinced that he was a demon of power: the strength
bleeding in his young limbs.
The one thing he would like to have been was a bullfighter.
He had once witnessed a bullfight at the cinema and he had
shivered from head to foot when he saw the bullfighter extend
his red cape. Olímpico had felt no compassion for the bull.
What he liked was to see blood.
In the North-east, he had saved week after week to earn
enough money to have a perfectly sound canine replaced with
a false tooth in glittering gold. A gold tooth gave him some
standing in society. Moreover, to have actually killed someone
had made him a MAN in capital letters. Olímpico felt no
remorse, he was what people in the North-east would call a
'brazen thug'. Olímpico, however, remained unaware that he
was also an artist. In his spare time he carved effigies of saints
which were so attractive that he decided not to sell them. He
carved in the smallest details and, without being disrespectful,
he left nothing of the Child Jesus' anatomy to the imagination.
As far as Olímpico was concerned, what exists, exists, and
Jesus was not only divine but also a man just like him minus
the gold tooth.
Olímpico was also interested in local politics. He loved listening
to public debates and speeches. Not that he didn't have his
own ideas about such matters. He would squat on the ground,
rolling a cigarette and thinking hard. Just as he used to squat
on the ground in his native Paraíba, his backside suspended in
mid-air, while he meditated. He would speak out in a loud
voice even if there was no one listening.
— I'm an intelligent chap and one of these days I'll be in
politics myself.
After all, didn't he have a gift for making speeches? He
possessed that singsong intonation and those unctuous phrases
one associates with the man who makes public speeches
defending and upholding human rights. After all, was he not
destined to become a politician one day? (An event this story
does not cover.) And when that day comes, he will expect to
be treated with some respect.
Macabéa was undeniably a primitive creature while Olímpico de
Jesus saw himself as a man about town, the type of man for
whom all doors open.
I am determined to avoid any sentimentality so I shall
eliminate, without further ado, any hint of compassion implicit in
this story. I should mention that Macabéa had never received a
letter in her life. And any telephone calls in the office were
always for the boss or for Glória. Macabéa once asked
Olímpico if he wouldn't care to telephone her at the office. He
made a crushing reply:
— Who wants to listen to you talking nonsense on the
telephone?
When Olímpico insisted that one day he would become a
politician in his native state of Paraíba, she was astounded and
thought to herself: when we get married does that mean that I
shall be a politician as well? She didn't fancy the idea because
the word 'politician' sounded quite unpleasant. (As I explained,
this is not a story about abstractions. Later, I shall probably
return to the unnamed sensations, perhaps even the sensations
of God Himself. But Macabéa's story must be told or else I
shall explode.)
On the rare occasion when the couple actually held a
conversation, they invariably discussed food: flour, salted beef,
dried meat, brown sugar and molasses. These commodities
symbolized their past and made them forget their unhappy
childhood because in retrospect, memories of childhood are
always bitter-sweet and even provoke a certain nostalgia.
Olímpico and Macabéa could have been mistaken for brother
and sister, a factor — I've only now realized — that would
appear to rule out any possibility of their marrying. I'm not
sure that they were aware of this factor. Will they get married?
I still don't know. All I know is that they were both ingenuous
and altogether insignificant.
No, I'm mistaken. It's now clear that Olímpico was by no
means ingenuous, however much the universal victim. It's now
clear to me that he was wicked to the core. He enjoyed taking
his revenge. Revenge gave him an enormous satisfaction and
the strength to go on living. He had more strength than
Macabéa, whose guardian angel had deserted her.
In the end, what had to happen would happen. Meantime
nothing whatsoever happened, for neither of them knew how
to invent happenings. They sat on something free of charge: a
bench in the public park. Sitting there, they were
indistinguishable from the rest of nothingness. For the greater
glory of God.
He — Well.
She — Well what?
He — I only said well!
She — But well what?
He — Let's change the subject. You'll never understand.
She — Understand what?
He — Mother of God! Macabéa, let's change the subject  at
once!
She — What shall we talk about then?
He — About you.
She — Me!
He — Why the fuss? Aren't you a human being? Human 
beings talk about other human beings.
She — Forgive me, but I don't believe that I am all that 
human.
He — Everybody's human, dear God!
She — I've never got used to the idea.
He — Never got used to what?
She — I can't explain.
He — So?
She — So what?
He — Look, I'm going. You're a dead loss.
She — I can't help being a dead loss. What do you want  me
to do about it?
He — You talk a load of rubbish. Try to talk about  something
. . . anything.
She — I don't know what to talk about.
He — You don't know what?
She — Eh?
He — Look, you're getting on my nerves. Let's just  shut up.
Agreed?
She — Whatever you say.
He — You're really a hopeless case. As for me, I've been
called so many things that I've turned into myself. In the
backwoods of Paraíba everybody has heard of Olímpico. And
one day the whole world is going to be talking about me.
She — Really?
He — Isn't that what I'm telling you! Don't you believe  me?
She — Of course I believe you, I believe you, I believe you. I
didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
When she was a little girl, Macabéa had seen a house painted
white and pink with a back-yard that boasted a well and
water-clock. It was exciting to look down the well. And so this
became Macabéa's great ambition: to possess a house one day
with its own well. Except that she didn't know how to set
about realizing her ambition so she asked Olímpico:
— Can you tell me if anybody can buy a well?
— Look here, hasn't it dawned on you that there aren't any
answers to the questions you ask?
She stood there leaning her head to one side like a dove
when it's feeling sad.
Once when he talked about getting rich, she asked him:
— Are you sure you're not having visions?
— Go to blazes! You don't trust anybody. Only the fact that
you're a virgin stops me from cursing you.
— Don't get upset! They say getting upset can affect your
stomach.
— Upset, my foot! Make no mistake, I'm on the way to
success. You're the one who should be worrying!
— I don't have any worries. I don't need to be successful. This
was the first time she had ever spoken of herself to Olímpico
de Jesus, accustomed as she was to forgetting about herself.
Macabéa never broke her routine. She was afraid of inventing
situations.
— Did I tell you that they said on the radio that a man who
was also a mathematician, wrote a book called Alice in
Wonderland? They also discussed elgebra. What does
elgebra mean?
— Only queers are interested in things like that, men who've
turned into pansies. Excuse the word queer. That's something
no decent girl should know about.
— On the radio they discuss 'culture' and use difficult words.
For instance, what does 'electronic' mean?
Silence.
— I know what it means but I'm not telling you.
— I love to hear the pings as the minutes pass:
tic-tac-tic-tac-tic-tac. Radio Clock says that it broadcasts the
correct time, culture and commercials. What does culture
mean?
— Culture is culture, he replied grudgingly. Why don't you get
off my back?
— There are so many things I don't understand. What does
'income per head' mean?
— That's easy, it has something to do with medicine.
— What does Count of Bonfim Street mean? What's a Count?
Is that the same as a prince?
— A Count is a Count, for God's sake! Besides, I don't need
to know the correct time. I wear a watch.
What he didn't tell Macabéa was that he'd stolen it in a
washroom at the factory: another worker had left it over the
sink while he was washing his hands. Nobody suspected that
Olímpico was very skilful when it came to stealing: needless to
say, he didn't wear the watch at work.
— Do you know the best thing I've learned? They said on
Radio Clock that we should be glad to be alive. And I am. I
also heard some lovely music and I almost wept.
— Was it a samba?
— I believe it was. It was sung by a man called Caruso who
they said died a long time ago. His voice was so gentle that it
was almost painful to listen to. The music was called Una
Furtiva Lacrima. I don't know why they couldn't say lágrima
the way it's said in Brazil.
Una Furtiva Lacrima had been the only really beautiful thing
in Macabéa's life. Drying her tears, she tried to sing what she
had heard. But Macabéa's voice was as rough and tuneless as
the rest of her body. When she heard her own voice, she
began to weep. She was weeping for the first time and had
never imagined that there was so much water in her eyes. She
wept and blew her nose, no longer knowing why she was
weeping. She wasn't weeping because of the way she lived:
never having known any other way of life, she accepted the
fact that her life was 'so' — just like Macabéa's herself.
I also believe she was weeping because the music helped her
to perceive that there were other ways of feeling; that there
were more delicate forms of existence and certain spiritual
refinements. She perceived lots of things that she could not
understand. Did the word aristocracy, for example, mean
some grace that had been granted? Most likely. If that were
the case, so be it. She penetrated the vast world of music that
required no understanding. Her heart exploded. In the
company of Olímpico she suddenly became courageous and,
plunging into the mysterious depths of her own being, she
said:
— I'm sure I can sing that music. La-la-la-la-la.
— You look like a deaf-mute trying to sing. Your voice is like a
broken reed.
— That's because I'm singing for the first time in my life. She
was sure that lacrima instead of the Portuguese lágrima was
an error on the part of the programme announcer. The
existence of another language had never occurred to Macabéa,
and she was convinced that in Brazil one could only speak
Brazilian. Apart from the cargo ships that she could watch on
the waterfront every Sunday, she only possessed this music.
The ultimate substratum of the music was her only vibration.
The flirtation with Olímpico remained lukewarm. He told her:
— After my sainted mother died, there was nothing to keep
me in Paraíba.
— What did she die of?
— Of nothing. Her health gave out.
Olímpico concerned himself with important things but Macabéa
only noticed unimportant things such as herself. Just as she
noticed a gate that was rusting, twisted, creaking and with its
paint peeling off; a gate that led to a number of outhouses
that all looked alike and were grouped around a villa. She had
observed all this from the bus. The villa was numbered 106
and on a plaque she read the name 'Sunrise'. An attractive
name that inspired confidence.
Macabéa found Olímpico very knowledgeable about things. He
told her things that she had never heard of before. Once he
told her:
— A person's face is the most important thing because the
face betrays what that person is thinking: your face is that of
somebody who has just tasted a sour apple. I can't abide sad
faces. Stop looking so mournful — then he came out with a
difficult word — he said: try to change your demeanour.
She replied in dismay:
— I can't do anything about my face. But it's only my face
that's sad, because I'm really quite happy inside. It's wonderful
to be alive, don't you think?
— Sure! But the good life is only for the privileged. I'm one of
them. I may look small and skinny but I'm really quite strong
and I could lift you off the ground with one arm. Let me
show you.
— No, no, there are people watching and they'll start laughing
at us!
— Don't be such a ninny, nobody's watching us. They walked
to the corner of the street. Macabéa was overjoyed. He really
could lift her up above his head. She shouted gaily:
— This is like flying in an airplane.
That's right! Suddenly he couldn't support her weight on one
arm any longer and she fell on her face in the mud, blood
spurting from her nostrils. She was tactful, however, and
quickly reassured him:
— Don't worry, it's nothing serious.
Having no handkerchief to wipe the mud and blood off her
face, Macabéa rubbed her face with the hem of her skirt. She
pleaded with him: Please don't look while I'm cleaning my face.
No decent girl ever lifts her skirt when there are people
watching.
Olímpico was becoming extremely impatient but made no reply.
After this little episode, he didn't make any attempt to see her
again for days: his pride had been injured.
They eventually bumped into each other again. For quite
different reasons they had wandered into a butcher's shop.
Macabéa only had to smell raw meat in order to convince
herself that she had eaten. What attracted Olímpico, on the
other hand, was the sight of a butcher at work with his sharp
knife. He envied the butcher and would dearly have liked to be
in the trade himself. To cut into raw meat with a sharp knife
never failed to get him excited. Both of them walked out of the
butcher's shop feeling deeply satisfied. Even so, Macabéa
couldn't help wondering what the taste of meat was like. And
Olímpico pondered: how does one train to be a butcher? What
was the secret? (Glória's father worked in a well-stocked
butcher's shop.)
Macabéa spoke:
— I shall miss myself so much when I die.
— Rubbish, when you're dead, you're dead and that's that.
— That's not what my aunt told me.
— Damn your aunt!
— Do you know what I really want to be? A movie-star. I
only go to the cinema when the boss pays me my wages. I
prefer third-class cinemas because they're much cheaper. I
adore movie-stars. Did you know that Marilyn Monroe was the
colour of peaches?
— And you're the colour of mud. What makes you think that
you've got the face or the body to become a film star?
— Am I really so awful?
— Take a good look at yourself in the mirror.
— I can't stand the sight of blood when I go to the cinema.
Honestly, I can't stand it. It makes me feel like vomiting.
— Vomiting or weeping?
— Up till now, thanks be to God, I've managed not to vomit.
— I'll bet! There isn't much milk in this cow.
It was so difficult to think. She didn't know how one set about
thinking. Olímpico, on the other hand, was able to think and to
use fine words. She would never forget their first meeting
when he addressed her as 'missy', and made her feel that she
was somebody. Once she became somebody, she even felt
justified in buying herself a pink lipstick. Her conversation
always sounded hollow. She was remotely aware that she had
never uttered the right word. She never referred to 'love' as
love, but settled for some vague expression or other.
— Look, Macabéa . . .
— Look where?
— God Almighty! Not 'look' meaning to see, but 'look' meaning
I want you to listen! Are you listening to me?
— Every word, every single word!
— How can you be listening to every word, dear God, if I
haven't said anything so far! Look, I'm going to treat you to a
coffee at the snack-bar. How's that?
— Can I have a drop of milk in my coffee?
— Sure, if it costs the same. If it costs any extra, you pay the
difference.
Macabéa didn't cost Olímpico anything. Except on this occasion
when he bought her a coffee with milk, to which she added
spoonful after spoonful of sugar. So much sugar that she
almost vomited, but she managed to hold it down for fear of
disgracing herself. She always added spoonfuls of sugar in
order to make sure she got value for her money.
On one occasion they visited the Zoological Gardens and
Macabéa paid for her own entrance ticket. She was terrified
when she saw the animals in their cages. They terrified her
and she couldn't make out what they were: why did they
exist? When she spotted the rhinoceros, a solid, compact, black
shape that moved in slow motion, she got such a shock that
she wet her knickers. The rhinoceros was surely one of God's
mistakes, she thought, begging His pardon for such blasphemy.
She didn't have any special God in mind, it was simply a way
of expressing herself. By some divine intervention, Olímpico
didn't appear to notice that anything was wrong. She made up
a story:
— I'm all wet because I sat on a damp bench.
He showed no reaction. She prayed mechanically, she felt so
grateful. It wasn't gratitude to God. Macabéa was only repeating
what she had learned as a child.
— The giraffe is so graceful, don't you think?
— Rubbish. You can't talk about animals being graceful. How
she wished she could reach high up into the air like the
giraffe. When she realized that her remark about the animals
displeased Olímpico, she tried to change the topic of
conversation:
— On Radio Clock they used a word that worried me:
mimetism.
Olímpico eyed her disapprovingly:
— That's not a nice word for a virgin to be using. Why do
you have to keep on asking questions about things that don't
concern you? The brothels in the Mangue are full of women
who asked far too many questions.
— Is the Mangue a district?
— It's an evil place frequented only by men. This won't sink
in, but I'm going to tell you something. A chap can still get a
woman on the cheap. You've only cost me a coffee so far.
That's your lot. I won't be wasting any more money buying
you things. Is that clear?
Macabéa thought to herself: he's right. I don't deserve anything
from him because I've wet my knickers.
After their walk in the rain through the Zoological Gardens,
Olímpico was no longer the same: he was in a foul temper.
Forgetting that he himself was rather silent, as one would
expect of someone as virile as Olímpico, he bellowed at her:
— Holy smoke! When are you going to open your mouth to
say something?
Deeply wounded, Macabéa replied:
— Did you know that the Emperor Charlemagne was called
Carolus in his native land! Did you also know that a fly travels
so fast that if it were to fly in a straight line it would travel
the whole universe in twenty-eight days?
— That's a downright lie!
— No it's not, I swear before God that the announcer said so
on Radio Clock.
— Well, I don't believe you.
— May I drop dead this minute if I'm telling a lie. May my
father and mother burn in hell, if I were to deceive you.
— You'd better watch out or you will drop dead. Listen to me:
are you playing dumb or are you just plain stupid?
— I don't know what I am. I think I'm a little . . . how can I
put it? — Honestly, I don't know what I am.
— At least you know that you're called Macabéa?
— That's true. But I don't know what's inside my name. The
only thing I know for certain is that I've never had much to
offer . . .
— Well, you'd better get it into your thick skull that my name
will be in all the papers one day and I'll be famous.
She asked Olímpico:
— Did I tell you that in the street where I live there's a
cockerel that sings?
— Why do you have to tell so many lies?
— I swear it, may my mother drop dead if it isn't true!
— Isn't your old girl already dead?
— Oh, so she is . . . How awful. . .
(But what about me? Here I am telling a story about events
that have never happened to me or to anyone known to me.
I am amazed at my own perception of the truth. Can it be
that it's my painful task to perceive in the flesh truths that no
one wants to face? If I know almost everything about Macabéa,
it's because I once caught a glimpse of this girl with the sallow
complexion from the North-east. Her expression revealed
everything about her. As for the youth from Paraíba, I must
have had his face imprinted on my mind. When one registers
a face spontaneously without any preconceptions, that face
reveals everything.)
I am now about to efface myself once more and return to my
two characters who were transformed by circumstances into
two semi-abstract human beings.
I still haven't filled in all the details about Olímpico. He came
from the backwoods of Paraíba. His determination to survive
stemmed from his roots in a region noted for its primitive,
savage way of life, its recurring spells of drought. Olímpico had
arrived in Rio with a tin of perfumed vaseline and a comb, his
sole possessions purchased at an open market in Paraíba. He
rubbed the vaseline into his hair until it was wet and glossy. It
never occurred to him that the girls in Rio might be put off by
that lank, greasy hair. He had been born looking more
shrivelled and scorched than a withered branch or a stone
lying in the sun. Olímpico had a better chance of surviving
than Macabéa, for it wasn't by accident that he had killed a
rival in the heart of the backwoods: his long, sharp knife had
punctured his victim's soft liver with the greatest ease. He had
kept this crime a secret, and he enjoyed that sense of power
which secrecy can bestow. Olímpico had proved his manliness
in combat. Yet he lost all courage when it came to attending
funerals: sometimes he attended as many as three funerals a
week; the funerals of complete strangers whose names
appeared in the obituary columns of O Dia. As he read them,
his eyes would fill with tears. It showed weakness on his part,
but everyone has some weakness or other. A week that passed
without a funeral left Olímpico feeling empty. It sounds like
madness, but Olímpico knew precisely what he was after. He
wasn't the least bit mad. Macabéa, unlike Olímpico, was a
crossbreed between one 'quiddity' and another. Truly she
seemed to have been conceived from some vague notion in the
minds of starving parents. Olímpico at least stole, whenever he
had the opportunity, even from the watchman at the factory
who provided him with shelter. To have killed someone and to
have stolen meant that he was no mere accident of nature.
His crimes gave him prestige and made him a man whose
honour had already been purged. He had an additional
advantage over Macabéa. Olímpico had a considerable talent for
drawing instant caricatures of well-known personalities, whose
photographs regularly appeared in the press. This was his
revenge. His only act of kindness toward Macabéa was his
offer to get her a job in the metal factory, should she be given
the sack. His offer made her deliriously happy (bang) for in
the metal factory she would find her only real connection with
the world: Olímpico. Macabéa didn't worry too much about her
own future: to have a future was a luxury. She had learned
from her favourite radio programme that there were seven
billion inhabitants in the world. She felt completely lost. But it
was in her nature to be happy so she soon resigned herself:
there were seven billion inhabitants to keep her company.
Macabéa had a passion for horror films and musicals. She
especially liked films where the women were hanged or shot
through the heart with a bullet. It never dawned on her that
she herself was a suicide case even though she had never
contemplated killing herself. Her life was duller than plain bread
and butter. By contrast, Olímpico was a demon of strength
and vitality who had fathered children. He possessed the
precious semen in abundance. And as was said or left unsaid,
Macabéa had ovaries as shrivelled as overcooked mushrooms.
Oh, if only I could seize Macabéa, give her a good scrubbing
and a plate of hot soup, kiss her on the forehead and tuck
her up in bed. So that she might wake up to discover the
great luxury of living.
Olímpico — as I now discover — derived little satisfaction from
courting Macabéa. Olímpico probably realized that Macabéa
lacked substance like most inferior products. However, when he
set eyes on Glória, Macabéa's work- mate, he felt at once that
here was a girl with real class.
Glória had rich Portuguese wine in her blood and a provocative
way of swinging her hips as she walked, no doubt due to
some remote strain of African blood. Although she was white,
Glória displayed that vitality one associates with a mulatta. She
dyed her curly mop of hair bright yellow though the roots
remained dark. But even without the peroxide she was fair,
and that made her superior as far as Olímpico was concerned.
This was a point in her favour no North-easterner could
ignore. And when Glória was introduced to him by Macabéa,
she assured him: 'I'm carioca born and bred!' Olímpico had
never heard the expression 'born and bred', an expression that
had been popular in Rio when Glória's parents were children.
To be carioca identified Glória with the privileged class who
inhabited Southern Brazil. Looking closely at her, Olímpico
perceived at once that, although she was ugly, Glória was well
nourished. This was enough to transform her into someone of
quality.
In the meantime, his affair with Macabéa waned into a
lukewarm routine. Not that one could ever have described it as
being warm. More and more often he failed to turn up at the
bus stop. But at least he was still her boy-friend. Macabéa
anxiously awaited the day when he would finally propose that
they should become engaged. And marry.
Olímpico soon learned in a roundabout way that Glória had a
father and mother, and that she ate a hot meal at the same
hour every day. These details transformed her into someone of
first-class quality. Olímpico was thrilled when he found out that
Glória's father worked in a butcher's shop. Watching those hips,
Olímpico could see that Glória was made for bearing children.
Macabéa, by comparison, had all the signs of her own
unmistakable doom.
It was quite alarming to observe how the breath of life surged
within Macabéa's parched body; expansive and diffused, and as
abundant as the breath of a pregnant woman, impregnated by
herself, by parthenogenesis: she experienced the weirdest
dreams with visions of immense prehistoric animals, as if she
were living in some more remote age of this violent territory.
At this point (bang), the affair between Olímpico and Macabéa
came to an abrupt end. It had been a curious affair yet was
somehow akin to the paler shades of love. Olímpico bluntly
informed her that he had met another girl and that the other
girl in question was Glória. (Bang) Macabéa saw at once what
had happened between Olímpico and Glória: their eyes had
met and kissed.
Confronted with Macabéa's vacant expression, Olímpico was
almost tempted to offer some words of comfort before saying
goodbye. As he was about to take his leave, he quipped:
— Macabéa, you're like a hair in one's soup. It's enough to
make anyone lose their appetite. I don't want to hurt your
feelings, but you might as well know the truth. Are you
offended?
— No, no, no! Please leave me alone! Say goodbye and go!
It is better not to speak of happiness or unhappiness — such
words provoke that vague nostalgia suffused in lilac, the
perfume of violets, those gelid tidal waters that send spray over
the sands. I have no desire to provoke any of these things for
they are painful.
I forgot to mention that Macabéa had one unfortunate trait:
she was sensual. How could there be so much sensuality in a
body as withered as hers, without her even suspecting its
presence? A mystery. At the outset of her affair with Olímpico,
she had asked him for a small photograph, three by four
centimetres, which showed him smiling broadly and showing off
his gold tooth. She was so excited when he gave it to her that
she said three Our Fathers and two Hail Marys to recover her
composure.
When Olímpico told her the affair was over, her reaction
(bang) was immediate and totally unexpected: she suddenly
started laughing. She laughed because she had forgotten how
to weep. Surprised and puzzled, Olímpico went into hoots of
laughter.
The two of them stood there laughing. At that moment,
Olímpico had an intuition, that came close to being an act of
kindness: he asked Macabéa if she was laughing because she
felt nervous. She stopped laughing, and suddenly feeling very,
very tired, she replied: I don't really know . . .
Macabéa, however, knew one thing: Glória was the embodiment
of vigorous existence. This was probably due to the fact that
Glória was buxom. Macabéa had always secretly longed to be
buxom, after hearing a young man in Maceió say to a girl
who was passing by; 'You're a buxom beauty!' From that
moment onwards, she had studied ways and means of putting
on some flesh. She even summoned enough courage to ask
her aunt to buy her some cod liver oil. (Already addicted to
advertisements, she had read about cod liver oil.) Her aunt
rebuked her: Who do you think you are, some rich man's
daughter, accustomed to luxuries?
Since it was not in her nature to be downhearted, she tried to
carry on after Olímpico abandoned her as if nothing had
happened. (She felt no despair, etc. etc.) Besides, what else
could she do? She was a lost cause. And even sadness was
the privilege of the rich, of those who could afford it, of those
who had nothing better to do. Sadness was a luxury.
I should also mention that on the day after Olímpico
abandoned her, Macabéa had an idea. Since nobody wanted to
give her a treat, much less become engaged to her, she would
give herself a treat. The treat would consist of buying a new
lipstick she didn't really need: not pink like the one she was
using, but this time bright red. In the washroom at the office
she painted her lips lavishly beyond their natural outline, in the
hope that she might achieve that stunning effect seen on the
lips of Marilyn Monroe. When she had finished, she stood
staring at herself in the mirror, at a face which stared back in
astonishment. The thick lipstick looked like blood spurting from
a nasty gash, as if someone had punched her on the mouth
and broken her front teeth (small bang). When she went back
to her desk Glória chuckled:
— Have you taken leave of your senses, girl? What are you
up to, wearing all that war-paint? You could be mistaken for a
tart.
— I'm a virgin! You won't find me going out with soldiers or
sailors.
— Excuse my asking: is it painful being ugly?
— I've never really thought about it, I suppose it's a little
painful. How do you feel about it being ugly yourself?
— I am not ugly! — Glória howled at her.
Peace was soon restored between them, and Macabéa
continued to be happy thinking about nothing. Empty, empty.
As I said before, she had no guardian angel. But she made
the best of things. Beyond that, she was almost impersonal.
Glória probed:
— Why are you always asking me for aspirin? I don't grudge
you the odd aspirin, but pills cost money.
— To stop the pain.
— What do you mean? Eh? Are you in pain?
— I'm in pain all the time.
— Where?
— Inside. I can't explain it.
More and more, she was finding it difficult to explain. She had
transformed herself into organic simplicity. She had contrived a
way of finding grace in simple, authentic things. She liked to
feel the passage of time. She did not possess a watch, and
perhaps for that very reason, she relished the infinity of time.
Her life was supersonic. Yet no one noticed that she had
crossed the sound barrier with her existence. For other people,
she didn't exist. Her only advantage over others was to know
how to swallow pills at one go, without any water. Glória, who
supplied her with aspirin, was full of admiration and this
kindled a pleasing warmth in Macabéa's heart. Glória warned
her:
— One of these days the aspirin will stick in your throat and
you'll be running around the office like a beheaded chicken.
One day Macabéa enjoyed a moment of ecstasy. It happened
in front of a tree that was so enormous that she couldn't put
her arms around its trunk. Yet despite her ecstasy, she did not
abide with God. She prayed with total indifference. True. Yet
that mysterious God of others sometimes bestowed on her a
state of grace. Bliss, bliss, bliss. Her soul almost took flight.
She, too, had become a flying saucer. She had tried to confide
in Glória but decided against it. She didn't know how to
express herself and what was there to confide? The
atmosphere? One doesn't confide everything, for everything is a
hollow void.
Sometimes, grace descended upon her as she sat at her desk
in the office. Then she would go to the washroom in order to
be alone. Standing and smiling until it passed. (It strikes me
that this God was extremely merciful towards her: He restored
what He had taken from her.) Standing and thinking about
nothing, a vacant expression in her eyes.
Not even Glória could be called a friend: just a workmate.
Glória, who was buxom, white and tepid. Her body exuded a
peculiar smell, and it was quite obvious that she didn't wash
much. She bleached the hairs on her legs and under the
armpits without bothering to shave them. Olímpico wondered:
was she bleached down below as well?
Towards Macabéa, Glória felt vaguely maternal. Whenever she
saw Macabéa looking more shrivelled than usual, she would
chide her:
— Why are you looking like . . . ?
Macabéa, who never lost her temper with anyone, had to
control her impatience with Glória, who had this irritating habit
of never finishing a sentence. Glória used an overpowering
cologne that smelled of sandalwood, and Macabéa, who had a
delicate stomach, always felt queasy when she inhaled the
odour. She preferred to say nothing because Glória was now
her only remaining contact with the world. A world that
consisted of her aunt, Glória, Senhor Raimundo and Olímpico
— and more remotely, the girls with whom she stared a room.
To compensate, she identified with a portrait of the young
Greta Garbo. This surprised me, for I could not imagine any
affinity between Macabéa and an actress with a face like
Garbo. Although she couldn't explain it, Macabéa was convinced
that Garbo was the most important woman in the world. She
herself felt no inclination to be like the haughty Greta Garbo,
whose tragic sensuality placed her on a solitary pedestal. What
Macabéa wanted most of all, as I've already said, was to look
like Marilyn Monroe.
She rarely confided in anyone, but one day she made the
mistake of telling Glória about her secret ambition. Glória burst
out laughing:
— You, Maca, looking like Marilyn Monroe? Have you seen
yourself in the mirror?
Glória was terribly smug: in her own estimation, she thought of
herself as being really something. Conscious of her mulatta sex
appeal, she painted in a beauty spot above her lips, to add a
touch of glamour to the bleached hairs around her mouth.
Glória was a cunning vixen but none the less good-hearted.
Macabéa's situation worried her, but there was little she could
do to improve matters. After all, no one forced Macabéa to be
quite so foolish? And as Glória reminded herself: she's not my
responsibility.
No one can enter another's heart. Macabéa conversed with
Glória — without ever opening her heart.
Glória wiggled her bottom in an inviting way and she smoked
mentholated cigarettes to keep her breath fresh for those
interminable kissing sessions with Olímpico. She was very
self-confident, having achieved most of her modest ambitions in
life. There was a defiant note in Glória's attitude as if to say:
'Nobody bosses me around.' One day she suddenly began to
stare and stare and stare at Macabéa.
Until she couldn't keep silent any longer and, speaking with the
slightest trace of Portuguese ancestry in her accent, she said:
— Hey girl, haven't you any face?
— Of course I have a face. It's just that my nose is flat. After
all, I'm from Alagoas.
— Tell me something: do you ever think about your future?
The question remained unanswered, for Macabéa had nothing
to say.
Very well. Let us return to Olímpico.
In an attempt to impress Glória and play the macho, he
bought red hot peppers at the market frequented by
North-easterners, and to show his new girl-friend just how
tough he was, he bit right into the devil's fruit. He didn't even
drink a glass of water to quell the burning sensation. The
unbearable pain made him feel tough and a terrified Glória
suddenly became submissive. He thought to himself: I'm a
conqueror, after all. And he attacked Glória with the
ferociousness of a male bee, craving for her honey and that
succulent flesh. He felt no remorse for having ditched Macabéa.
He was destined to go up in the world and join the privileged.
Olímpico was determined to change his life. By associating with
Glória, this insignificant metal-worker from the North-east was
about to prosper. He would cease to be what he had always
been and what he had always refused to acknowledge,
ashamed of his own weakness. Even as a child he had been a
lonely creature who found it difficult to breathe in space. The
man from the backwoods is, above all, patient. I find it easy to
forgive him.
Glória, wishing to make amends for having stolen her boy
friend, invited Macabéa to tea one Sunday afternoon at her
parents' house. Kissing the wound better after biting someone?
(This story is so banal that I can scarcely bear to go on
writing.)
This invitation (small bang) caused Macabéa to open her eyes
wide. In the foul disorder of a third-class surburban bourgeoisie
one could still count upon eating well, for most of their money
was spent on food. Glória lived in a street named after some
General or other. It gave her enormous satisfaction to be able
to say that she lived in a street that commemorated a military
leader. This made her feel much more secure. In Glória's
house there was even a telephone. This was probably one of
the few occasions when Macabéa realized why there was no
place for her in this world and why Glória was being so
generous. A cup filled to the brim with piping hot chocolate
mixed with real milk, a selection of sugared buns and even a
small cake. While Glória was out of the room, Macabéa furtively
ate a biscuit. She then asked to be forgiven by the Abstract
Being, the Giver and Taker of all things. She felt she had been
forgiven. The Abstract Being had shown mercy.
On the following day, which was a Monday, perhaps because
the chocolate had affected her liver or because of her
nervousness about drinking something intended for the rich,
Macabéa felt unwell.
With an act of will-power, she prevented herself from vomiting
in her determination not to squander that delicious chocolate.
Some days later, when she received her wages, she summoned
enough courage for the first time in her life (bang) to make
an appointment with a doctor recommended by Glória, who
didn't charge much. He examined her, examined her a second
time, and then a third time.
— Are you dieting to lose weight, my girl? Macabéa didn't
know how to reply.
— What do you eat?
— Hot dogs.
— Is that all?
— Sometimes I eat a mortadella sandwich.
— What do you drink? Milk?
— Only coffee and soft drinks.
— What do you mean by soft drinks? — He probed, not quite
knowing how to proceed. He questioned her at random:
— Do you sometimes have fits of vomiting?
— Oh, never! — she exclaimed in a panic, for she was not a
fool to go wasting food, as I've explained. The doctor took a
good look at her and felt sure that she didn't diet to lose
weight. Nevertheless, he found it easier to go on insisting that
she shouldn't diet to lose weight. He knew how things stood
and that he was the poor man's doctor. That was what he
muttered to himself as he prescribed a tonic that Macabéa
wouldn't even bother to buy: she believed it was sufficient to
consult a doctor in order to be cured. He snapped at her
without being able to account for his sudden outburst of
annoyance and indignation:
— This tale about a diet of hot dogs is pure neurosis. What
you need is a psychiatrist!
She had no idea what he was talking about but felt that the
doctor expected her to smile. So she smiled.
The doctor, who was corpulent and given to perspiring,
suffered from a nervous tic that caused him to purse his lips
at regular intervals. As a result, he looked like a pouting infant
about to burst into tears.
This doctor had no ambition whatsoever. He saw medicine
simply as a means of earning a living. It had nothing to do
with dedication or concern for the sick. He was negligent and
found the squalor of his patients utterly distasteful. He resented
having to deal with the poor whom he saw as the rejects of
that privileged society from which he himself had been
excluded. It had not escaped him that he was out of touch
with the latest trends in medicine and new clinical methods, but
he had all the training he was likely to need for treating the
lower orders. His dream was to earn enough money to do
exactly what he pleased: nothing.
When the doctor told Macabéa that he was about to give her
a medical examination, she said:
— I've been told you have to take your clothes off when you
visit a doctor, but I'm not taking anything off.
He gave her an X-ray and said:
— You're in the early stages of pulmonary tuberculosis.
Macabéa didn't know if this was a good or a bad thing.
But being ever so polite she simply said:
— Many thanks.
The doctor resisted any temptation to be compassionate. He
advised her: when you can't decide what you should eat, make
yourself a generous helping of Italian spaghetti.
With a mere hint of kindness in his voice, since he, too, had
been treated unjustly by fate, he added:
— It doesn't cost that much . . .
— I've never heard of the food you've just mentioned. Is it
good?
— Of course, it is! Just look at this paunch! It comes from
eating big helpings of spaghetti and drinking lots of beer.
Forget the beer. You had better avoid alcohol.
She repeated wearily:
— Alcohol?
— Shall I tell you something? I wish you'd get the hell out of
here!
Yes, I adore Macabéa, my darling Maca. I adore her ugliness
and her total anonymity for she belongs to no one. I adore
her for her weak lungs and her under-nourished body. How I
should like to see her open her mouth and say:
— I am alone in the world. I don't believe in anyone for they
all tell lies, sometimes even when they're making love. I find
that people don't really communicate with each other. The truth
comes to me only when I'm alone.
Maca, however, never expressed herself in sentences, first of all,
because she was a person of few words. She wasn't conscious
of herself and made no demands on anyone. Maca even
thought of herself as being happy. She was no idiot yet she
possessed the pure happiness of idiots. She did not think about
herself: she lacked self-awareness. (I can see that I've tried to
impose my own situation on Maca: I need several hours of
solitude every day, otherwise I die.)
Speaking for myself, I am only true when I'm alone. As a
child, I always feared that I was about to fall off the face of
the earth at any minute. Why do the clouds keep afloat when
everything else drops to the ground? The explanation is simple:
the gravity is less than the force of air that sustains the clouds.
Clever, don't you think? Yes, but sooner or later they fall in
the form of rain. That is my revenge.
She didn't confide any of this to Glória because on the whole
she told lies: she was ashamed of the truth. A lie was so
much more acceptable. Macabéa believed that to be
well-educated was the same as knowing how to tell lies. She
also lied to herself in daydreams that reflected her envy of her
work-mate. Glória, for instance, could be so imaginative.
Macabéa watched her saying goodbye to Olímpico. Glória would
put her finger-tips to her lips and blow a kiss into the air like
someone giving a bird its freedom. Such a gesture would never
have occurred to Macabéa.
(This story consists of nothing more than some crude items of
primary material that come to me directly before I even think
of them. I know lots of things that I cannot express. Besides,
where does thinking come into it?)
Glória, perhaps because she was feeling remorseful, said to
Macabéa:
— Olímpico is mine, but you are sure to find yourself another
boy friend. I know that Olímpico is mine because the
fortune-teller told me so. I mustn't ignore what she told me for
she's a clairvoyante and never makes mistakes. Why don't you
pay for a session and ask her to read your cards?
— Does it cost much?
I have grown weary of literature: silence alone comforts me. If
I continue to write, it's because I have nothing more to
accomplish in this world except to wait for death. Searching for
the word in darkness. Any little success invades me and puts
me in full view of everyone. I longed to wallow in the mud. I
can scarcely control my need for self-abasement, my craving
for licentiousness and debauchery. Sin tempts me, forbidden
pleasures lure me. I want to be both pig and hen, then kill
them and drink their blood. I think about Macabéa's vagina,
minute, yet unexpectedly covered with a thick growth of black
hairs — her vagina was the only vehement sign of her
existence.
She herself asked for nothing, but her sex made its demands
like a sunflower germinating in a tomb. As for me, I feel
weary. Perhaps of keeping company with Macabéa, Glória and
Olímpico. That doctor made me feel quite sick with his talk
about beer. I must interrupt this story for three days.
Now I awaken to find that I miss Macabéa. Let's take up the
threads again.
— Is it very dear?
— I'll loan you the money. Madame Carlota has the power to
break any spells that might be worrying her clients. She broke
mine on the stroke of midnight on Friday the thirteenth of
August over at San Miguel, on a pitch where they practise
voodoo. They bled a black pig and seven white hens over me
and tore my bloodstained clothes to shreds. Can you pluck up
enough courage?
— I don't know if I could stomach all that blood.
Perhaps because blood is everyone's secret, that life-giving
tragedy. But Macabéa only knew that she could not stomach
the sight of blood, the other reflections were mine. I am
becoming interested in facts: facts are solid stones. There is no
means of avoiding them. Facts are words expressed throughout
the world.
Well then.
Faced with this sudden offer of help, Macabéa, who never
remembered to ask for anything, asked her boss for time off
by pretending she had toothache. She accepted a loan from
Glória without having the faintest idea when she would be able
to pay her back. This bold decision surprisingly encouraged her
to make an even bolder decision (bang): since the money was
on loan, she reasoned somewhat perversely, and was not
strictly hers, then she was free to spend it. So for the first
time in her life she took a taxi and asked to be dropped in
Olaria. I suspect that she acted so boldly out of sheer
desperation, even though she didn't know that she was
desperate. She was at the end of her tether and felt completely
worn out.
Tracing Madame Carlota's address turned out to be
straightforward: so very straightforward that Macabéa thought
of it as being a favourable omen. Madame Carlota's
ground-floor apartment was situated on the corner of a
cul-de-sac. On the pavement tiny blades of grass sprouted
between the flagstones — Macabéa noticed them because she
always noticed things that were tiny and insignificant. She
thought dreamily, as she rang the doorbell: grass is so easy
and simple. Her thoughts were gratuitous and unconnected
because, however erratic, she possessed vast reserves of inner
freedom.
It was Madame Carlota herself who came to the door. She
greeted Macabéa amiably and said:
— My guiding spirit has already informed me of your visit, my
dear. What is your name again? Ah, yes! A very pretty name.
Come in, my pet. There is a client with me in the other room.
If you don't mind waiting in here. Would you care for a coffee,
my pet?
Macabéa was taken aback, never having received so many
endearments from anyone. Mindful of her own frail existence,
she cautiously sipped the cold coffee which tasted quite bitter.
Meantime, she examined with admiration and respect the room
in which she was being kept waiting. It all seemed very
luxurious. The chairs and settees were covered in yellow plastic.
And there were even plastic flowers. Plastic was the last word
in luxury. Macabéa sat with her mouth wide open.
Eventually, a young girl emerged from the back room, her eyes
red from weeping, and Madame Carlota beckoned Macabéa to
enter. (How tiresome to have to grapple with facts. Everyday
matters annihilate and I'm not in the mood for writing this
story which is merely a form of catharsis. I see that I am
writing here and there about myself. I accept no responsibility
for what I am writing.)
Let's continue then, however much effort it requires: Madame
Carlota was voluptuous; she painted her rosebud mouth a vivid
scarlet and dabbed her plump little cheeks with rouge, which
became shiny when applied to her greasy complexion. Madame
Carlota looked like a large china doll that had seen better days.
(I can see that my story lacks depth. I find it exhausting to
have to describe things.)
— Don't be frightened, my pet. Anyone at my side is also at
the side of Jesus.
Madame Carlota pointed at the coloured print on the wall
which represented the Sacred Heart of Jesus in red and gold.
— I'm a fan of Jesus. I'm just mad about Him. He has always
helped me. Mind you, in my heyday I had enough class to live
the life of a lady. Things were easier then, thanks to Jesus.
Later on, when I didn't rate quite so highly on the market,
Jesus lost no time in helping me to set up a brothel with a
friend. That earned me enough money to buy this ground-floor
apartment. I then gave up the brothel for it wasn't easy
looking after all those girls who spent most of their time
cheating me out of money. Are you interested in what I'm
telling you?
— Very.
Wise girl, for I'm not lying. You should become a fan of Jesus,
too, because the Saviour truly redeems. The police clamp down
on fortune-telling and accuse me of taking advantage of my
clients, but as I said before, not even the police can get rid of
Jesus. You have seen how Jesus even provided me with
money to buy all this expensive furniture?
— Yes, Madame.
— Ah, so you agree? I could tell right away that you're a
bright girl, and, just as well, because it was having my wits
about me that saved me.
As she spoke, Madame Carlota extracted one chocolate after
another from an open box and popped them into her tiny
mouth. She made no attempt to offer one to Macabéa.
Macabéa who, as I mentioned, tended to notice the smallest
detail, observed that inside every chocolate Madame Carlota bit
into, there was a thick cream filling. She did not covet
Madame Carlota's chocolates for Macabéa had discovered that
things belonged to others.
— I was poor, I had nothing to eat, no decent clothes to
wear. So I became a prostitute. I quite enjoyed the work for
I'm a very affectionate woman, and I became very fond of all
my clients. Besides, life was good in the red-light district. There
was a great deal of friendship among the prostitutes. We were
a closely-knit community, and only very rarely did I fight with
any of the other girls. The quarrels were enjoyable, too, for I
was a sturdy lass and I enjoyed punching, biting and pulling
the hair of anyone who crossed me. Speaking of biting, you
can't imagine what lovely teeth I once had, all white and
sparkling. Alas, they rotted so badly that I'm left with dentures.
Can you tell that my teeth are false?
— No, Madame.
You know, I was very fussy about my appearance and I never
caught any diseases. Well, I did have syphilis once, but a dose
of penicillin soon cured me. I was more understanding than
the other prostitutes because I'm very kind-hearted. After all,
what I was giving was mine to give. I had a man whom I
really adored and whom I kept for he was very genteel and
didn't want to soil his lovely hands. He was my little luxury,
and sometimes I even used to let him give me a good
thrashing. Whenever he gave me a thrashing, I could tell that
he was genuinely fond of me and I enjoyed being thrashed.
With him it was love, with the other men simply a job. After
he disappeared, I took up with another woman to try and
forget him. To be loved by another woman is really rather
nice. It would even be preferable in your case because you're
much too delicate to cope with the brutality of men. If you can
find yourself a woman friend, you'll soon find out how nice it
can be. Love between two women is more affectionate. Is there
any chance of you finding yourself a woman friend?
— No, Madame.
— You ought to do something about your appearance, dearie.
Without a touch of glamour, you don't stand a chance. How I
miss the red-light district. I knew the Mangue when it was at
its best and frequented by real gentlemen. I earned lots of tips,
in addition to the fixed rate. They tell me the Mangue is
finished and that there are only about six brothels left. I used
to stand in the doorway wearing nothing except panties and a
bra made of transparent lace. Later on, when I put on weight
and started losing my teeth, I decided to run my own brothel.
Do you know what the word brothel means? I always use that
word because I've never been frightened of words. There are
some people who get all worked up if you mention certain
words. Are you frightened of words, my pet?
— Yes, Madame, I am.
Don't worry, dear. I'll try not to shock you with swear words.
They tell me that the Mangue smells something terrible these
days. In my time, people burned incense to make the place
smell nice. The brothel used to smell like the inside of a
church. And people were decent and very devout. When I was
on the game, I saved quite a bit of money. The woman who
managed the brothel took her percentage, of course. Now and
then, there were ugly scenes and even gun fights, but I was
never involved. Tell me, flower, am I boring you with the story
of my life? No? Are you sure? Have you the patience to wait
just a little longer before I start reading your fortune?
— Of course, Madame Carlota.
Madame Carlota then went on to tell her how prettily she had
decorated the walls of her little cubicle in the brothel in the
Mangue.
— Have you ever been told what a nice smell men have, my
pet? It's good for one's health. Have you ever experienced a
man's smell?
— No, Madame Carlota.
Finally, after licking her lips, Madame Carlota ordered Macabéa
to divide the cards with her left hand. With your left hand, is
that clear, my little one?
Macabéa divided the pack with a trembling hand: for the first
time in her life, she was about to know her destiny. Madame
Carlota (bang) was to be the climax of her existence. The
vortex of her life as it was about to be channelled into that
voluptuous odalisque whose complexion shone like plastic under
the bright rouge. Madame Carlota opened her eyes wide.
— Poor little Macabéa, what a terrible life you have! May my
friend Jesus have pity on you, my child! How awful!
Macabéa turned pale: it had never occurred to her that her
life was so awful.
Madame Carlota divined everything about Macabéa's past, and
even revealed that she had never really known her own father
and mother and that she had been brought up by a relative
who had been as wicked as any stepmother. Macabéa was
horrified by these revelations. She had always believed that her
aunt had treated her badly for her own good. Madame Carlota
went on to say:
— As for your immediate future, my child, that's miserable as
well. You're about to lose your job just as you've already lost
your boy-friend, you poor little thing. If you haven't got the
money to pay me, don't you worry. I'm a woman of some
means.
Macabéa, unaccustomed as she was to receiving any favours,
turned down this generous offer but with a grateful heart.
Whereupon (bang) something happened out of the blue:
Madame Carlota's face suddenly lit up:
— Macabéa! I have some wonderful news for you! Listen
carefully, my flower, because what I'm about to tell you is of
the greatest importance. It is something very serious and very
cheerful: your life is about to change completely! And
something else: it will change the very minute you leave this
house! You will feel like a new person. And you can be sure,
my little one, that even your boy-friend will come back to you
and ask you to marry him, for he now regrets having left you!
And your boss is about to inform you that he's thought
matters over and no longer has any intention of giving you the
sack!
Macabéa had never had the courage to cherish hopes. Yet she
now listened to Madame Carlota as if she were listening to a
fanfare of trumpets coming from heaven — her heart beating
furiously. Madame was right: at long last, Jesus was taking
some interest in her. Macabéa's eyes opened wide as she felt a
sudden hunger for the future (bang). And I, too, am beginning
to cherish hope at last.
— Oh, there is something else! You are about to come in for
a great fortune that a foreign gentleman will bring to you in
the night. Do you know any foreign gentleman?
— No, Madame Carlota — Macabéa replied, beginning to feel
disheartened.
Then you are about to meet one. He is fair, with eyes that
could be blue or green or brown or black. And were it not
for the fact that you are in love with your former boy friend,
this foreigner would fall in love with you. No! No! No! I can
see something else (bang) and though I cannot see it very
clearly, I can also hear the voice of my guiding spirit: this
foreigner is apparently called Hans, and he is the man whom
you will marry! He has lots of money, but then all foreigners
are rich. Unless I'm mistaken, and I never make mistakes, he
is going to show you a great deal of affection: and you, my
poor little orphan, you will be dressed in satin and velvet, and
you will even be presented with a fur coat!
Macabéa began (bang) to tremble all over, for there is a
painful side to a surfeit of happiness. The only answer she
could think of:
— I don't need a fur coat in this climate.
— Well, you're going to have one just the same. There's
nothing like a fur coat to make a girl look chic. It's a long
time since I've read such good cards. I'm always frank with
my clients. For example, I've just told that girl you saw leaving
that she's going to be knocked down on the road. She wept
buckets. Didn't you notice how red her eyes were? I'm going
to give you a charm that you must wear tucked into your bra
and against your skin. You've no bust, poor thing, but you'll
start to fill out. Until you put on a little weight, stuff some
cotton-wool into your bra to give the impression that you've
got some shape. Listen, pet, I'm afraid I must charge you for
the charm in the name of Jesus, because all my earnings as a
fortune-teller are donated to an orphanage. But if you haven't
got the money on you, don't worry, you can pay me when all
the things I've foreseen finally came true.
— No, I'd rather pay you right away. You've guessed
everything about me, you're . . .
Macabéa felt almost inebriated and could scarcely gather her
thoughts. It was as if someone had delivered a sharp blow to
that head of lank hair. Macabéa felt totally confused as if some
great misfortune had befallen her.
Most of all, she was experiencing for the first time what other
people referred to as passion: she was passionately in love with
Hans.
— What can I do to get my hair to grow? — she bravely
asked Madame Carlota, now that she was feeling like a new
person.
— That's asking too much. But let me see: wash your head
with a good shampoo and never use hard soap. There's no
charge for that advice.
This as well? (bang) Macabéa's heart thumped furiously at the
thought of seeing her hair grow. She had put Olímpico from
her mind and could only think of the foreign gentleman: it was
almost too good to be true that she should find herself a man
with eyes that were blue or green or brown or black. She
couldn't go wrong. The range of possibilities was endless.
— And now — said Madame Carlota — you must go off in
search of that wonderful destiny. I have another client waiting
outside. Besides, I've given you extra time, dearie, but it was
worth it!
In a moment of impulse (bang) that was both eager and
awkward, Macabéa planted a resounding kiss on Madame
Carlota's rouged cheek. Once again, she sensed that her life
was suddenly taking a turn for the better. As a little girl,
because she had no one to kiss, she often used to kiss the
wall. Embracing the wall was like embracing herself.
Madame Carlota had guessed everything and Macabéa was
horrified. Only now did she recognize that her life had been
miserable. She felt like weeping as she perceived the other side.
For as I've already stated, until this moment, Macabéa had
thought of herself as being happy.
She walked out of Madame Carlota's apartment in a daze,
paused in the cul-de-sac that was already darkening in the
twilight — the twilight that belongs to no one. Her eyes
dimmed over as if the dying light was a stain of blood and
gold already turning to black. The atmosphere seemed charged
with riches and the face of descending night — oh, yes —
appeared deep and magnificent. Macabéa stood there in
bewilderment, uncertain whether she should cross the street
now that her life had been transformed. Transformed,
moreover, by words — since the time of Moses the word had
been acknowledged as being divine.
Even when it came to crossing the street, Macabéa was
already a new person. A person enriched with a future. She
felt within a hope more fierce than any anguish she had ever
known. If she was no longer herself, this signified a loss that
counted as a gain. Just as there was sentence of death, the
fortune-teller had decreed sentence of life. Everything suddenly
became so abundant and overwhelming, Macabéa felt like
weeping. But she didn't weep: her eyes glistened like the setting
sun.
The moment she stepped off the pavement, Destiny (bang)
swift and greedy, whispered: now, quickly, for my hour has
come!
And a yellow Mercedes, as huge as an ocean liner, knocked
her down. At that very moment, in some remote corner of the
world, a horse reared and gave a loud neigh, as if in
response.
As she fell to the ground, Macabéa saw in time, before the car
sped away, that Madame Carlota's prophecies were starting to
come true. The yellow Mercedes was truly luxurious. Her fall
was nothing serious, she thought to herself, she had simply lost
her balance. Her head had struck the edge of the pavement
and she remained lying there, her eyes turned towards the
gutter. The trickle of blood coming from the wound on her
temple was surprisingly thick and red. What I wanted to say
was that despite everything, she belonged to a resistant and
stubborn race of dwarfs that would one day vindicate the right
to protest.
(I could turn the clock back and happily start again at the
point when Macabéa was standing on the pavement — but it
isn't for me to say whether the fair-haired foreigner looked at
her. The fact is that I've already gone too far and there is no
turning back. Just as well that I did not, nor do I intend to
speak of death. I will simply call it an accident.)
Macabéa lay helpless by the side of the road. She felt drained
of all emotion as she looked at the stones around the sewer
and sprouting blades of wild grass; their greenness conveyed
the most tender hope. Today, she thought, today is the dawn
of my existence: I am born.
(Truth is always some inexplicable inner contact. Truth is
unrecognizable. Therefore, doesn't it exist? No, for men it
doesn't exist.)
Returning to the grass. For a creature as meagre as Macabéa,
abundant nature was offering itself in a few sparse blades of
grass growing in the gutter — were she to be offered the
mighty ocean or lofty mountain peaks, her soul, even more
chaste than her body, would hallucinate and her organism
would explode, arms and intestines scattered here and there, a
round, hollow head rolling at her feet — like a dismantled wax
dummy.
Suddenly, Macabéa paid a little attention to herself. Could this
be some muted earthquake? The land of Alagoas had opened
in gaping cracks. She stared, just for the sake of staring, at
the blades of grass. Grass in the great Metropolis of Rio de
Janeiro. Adrift. Who knows if Macabéa had ever felt at some
time that she, too, was adrift in the great unconquerable city?
For her, Destiny had decreed a dark cul-de-sac and a street
gutter. Was she suffering? I believe she was. Like a hen with
its neck half-severed, running about in a panic and dripping
blood. Except that the hen escapes — as one flees from pain
— clucking in desperation. Macabéa struggled in silence.
I shall do everything possible to see that she doesn't die. But I
feel such an urge to put her to sleep and then go off to sleep
myself.
There was a gentle drizzle. Olímpico was right: all Macabéa
was good for was for making sure that it rained. The fine
drops of freezing rain gradually soaked into her clothes, making
her feel extremely uncomfortable.
I ask myself: is every story that has ever been written in this
world, a story of suffering and affliction?
Some people appeared from nowhere in the cul-de-sac and
gathered round Macabéa. They just stood there doing nothing
just as people had always done nothing to help her; except
that these people peered at her and this gave her an existence.
(But who am I to censure the guilty? The worst part is that I
must forgive them. It is essential to arrive at an absolute zero
so that we indifferently come to love or not to love the
criminal who kills us. But I am no longer sure of myself: I
must ask, without knowing whom I should ask, if it is really
necessary to love the man who slays me; to ask who among
you is slaying me. My life, stronger than myself, replies that it
wants revenge at all costs. It warns me that I must struggle
like someone drowning, even if I should perish in the end. If it
be so, so be it.)
Is Macabéa about to die? How can I tell? Not even those
onlookers could tell. Although someone from a nearby house,
suspecting that she might be dying, placed a lit candle beside
her body. The luxury of that generous flame appeared to sing
of glory.
(I give the bare essentials, enhancing them with pomp, jewels
and splendour. Is this how one should write? No, not by
accretion but rather by denudation. But I am frightened of
nakedness, for that is the final word.)
Meanwhile, Macabéa, lying on the ground, seemed to become
more and more transformed into a Macabéa, as if she were
arriving at herself.
Is this a melodrama? What I can say is that melodrama was
the summit of her life. All lives are an art, and hers inclined
towards an outburst of restless weeping with thunder and
lightning.
A scrawny fellow appeared on the street-corner, wearing a
threadbare jacket and playing the fiddle. I should explain that,
when I was a child and living in Recife, I once saw this man
as dusk was falling. The shrill, prolonged sound of his playing
underlined in gold the mystery of that darkened street. On the
ground, beside this pitiful fellow, there was a tin can which
received the rattling coins of grateful bystanders as he played
the dirge of their lives. It is only now that I have come to
understand. Only now has the secret meaning dawned on me:
the fiddler's music is an omen. I know that when I die, I shall
hear him playing and that I shall crave for music, music,
music.
Macabéa, Hail Mary, full of grace, serene land of promise, land
of forgiveness, the time must come, ora pro nobis. I use
myself as a form of knowledge. I know you through and
through, by means of an incantation that comes from me to
you. To stretch out savagely while an inflexible geometry
vibrates behind everything. Macabéa remembered the docks.
The docks went to the heart of her existence.
Macabéa ask for pardon? One must always ask. Why? Reply:
it is so because it is so. Was it always so? It will always be so.
And if it were not so? But I am saying that it is so. Very well.
It was quite obvious that Macabéa was still alive, for her
enormous eyes went on blinking and her flat chest heaved and
fell as she struggled for breath. But who can tell if she was
not in need of dying? For there are moments when one needs
a taste of death without even realizing it. Personally, I substitute
the act of death with one of its symbols. A symbol that can be
summarized by a deep kiss, not up against a wall, but mouth
to mouth in the agony of pleasure that is death.
To my great joy, I find that the hour has not come for the
film-star Macabéa to die. At least, I cannot divine if she gets
her fair-haired foreigner. Pray for her and interrupt whatever
you're doing in order to breathe a little life into her, for
Macabéa is presently adrift, like a door swinging in a
never-ending breeze. I could resolve this story by taking the
easy way out and murdering the infant child, but what I want
is something more: I want life. Let my readers take a punch
in the stomach to see how they enjoy it. For life is a punch in
the stomach.
Meantime, Macabéa was nothing but a vague sentiment lying
on the dirty paving stones. I could leave her lying there and
simply not finish the story. But no. I shall go on until I reach
that point where the atmosphere finishes, where the howling
gale explodes, where the void makes a curve, where my breath
takes me. Does my breath deliver me to God? I am so pure
that I know nothing. I know only one thing: there is no need
to pity God. Or perhaps there is?
Macabéa had enough life left in her to stir gently and take up
the foetal position. She looked as grotesque as ever. Reluctant
to surrender, yet avid for the great embrace. She embraced
herself, longing for sweet nothingness. She was damned and
didn't know it. She clung to a thread of consciousness and
mentally repeated over and over again: I am, I am, I am.
Precisely who she was, she was unable to say. She had
searched in the deep, black essence of her own being, for that
breath of life granted by God.
As she lay there, she felt the warmth of supreme happiness,
for she had been born for death's embrace. Death is my
favourite character in this story. Was Macabéa about to bid
herself goodbye? I don't believe that she is going to die, for
she has so much will to live. There was even a suggestion of
sensuality in the way she lay there huddled up. Or is this
because pre-death resembles some intense sensual longing?
Macabéa's expression betrayed a grimace of desire. Things are
ever vesperal and if she is not dying now, then like us, she
has reached the vigil of death. Forgive me for reminding you,
for I find it difficult to forgive myself for this clairvoyance.
A sensation as pleasurable, tender, horrifying, chilling and
penetrating as love. Could this be the grace you call God? Yes?
Were she about to die, she would pass from being a virgin to
being a woman. No, this wasn't death. Death is not what I
want for this girl: a mere collision that amounted to nothing
serious. Her struggle to live resembled something that she had
never experienced before, virgin that she was, yet had grasped
by intuition. For only now did she understand that a woman is
born a woman from that first wail at birth. A woman's destiny
is to be a woman. Macabéa had perceived the almost painful
and vertiginous moment of overwhelming love. A painful and
difficult reflowering that she enacted with her body and that
other thing you call a soul and I call — what?
At that instant, Macabéa came out with a phrase that no one
among the onlookers could understand. She said in a clear,
distinct voice:
— As for the future.
Did she crave a future? I hear the ancient music of words
upon words. Yes, it is so. At this very moment Macabéa felt
nausea well up in the pit of her stomach and almost vomited.
She felt like vomiting something that was not matter but
luminous. Star with a thousand pointed rays.
What do I see now, that is so terrifying? I see that she has
vomited a little blood, a great spasm, essence finally touching
essence: victory!
And then — then suddenly the anguished cry of a seagull,
suddenly the voracious eagle soaring on high with the tender
lamb in its beak, the sleek cat mangling vermin, life devouring
life.
Et tu, Brute?
Yes, this was the way I had hoped to announce that — that
Macabéa was dead. The Prince of Darkness had triumphed.
Coronation at last.
What was the truth about my Maca? It is enough to discover
the truth that she no longer exists: the moment has passed. I
ask myself: what is she? Reply: she is not.
But don't grieve for the dead: they know what they're doing. I
have been to the land of the dead and after the most
gruesome horrors I have come back redeemed. I am innocent!
Do not devour me! I am not negotiable!
Alas, all is lost, and the greatest guilt would appear to be mine.
Let them bathe my hands and feet and then — then let them
anoint them with the holy, perfumed oils. Ah, such a longing
for happiness. I try forcing myself to burst out laughing. But
somehow I cannot laugh. Death is an encounter with self. Laid
out and dead, Macabéa looked as imposing as a dead stallion.
The best thing is still the following: not to die, for to die is not
enough. It fails to achieve my greatest need: self-fulfilment.
Macabéa has murdered me.
She is finally free of herself and of me. Do not be frightened.
Death is instantaneous and passes in a flash. I know, for I
have just died with the girl. Forgive my dying. It was
unavoidable. If you have kissed the wall, you can accept
anything. But suddenly I make one last gesture of rebellion and
start to howl: the slaughter of doves! To live is a luxury.
Suddenly it's all over.
Macabéa is dead. The bells were ringing without making any
sound. I now understand this story. She is the imminence in
those bells, pealing so softly.
The greatness of every human being.
Silence.
Should God descend on earth one day there would be a great
silence.
The silence is such, that thought no longer thinks.
Was the ending of my story as grand as you expected? Dying,
Macabéa became air. Vigorous air? I cannot say. She died
instantaneously. An instant is that particle of time in which the
tyre of a car going at full speed touches the ground, touches it
no longer, then touches it again. Etc., etc., etc. At heart,
Macabéa was little better than a music box sadly out of tune.
I ask you:
— What is the weight of light?
And now — now it only remains for me to light a cigarette
and go home. Dear God, only now am I remembering that
people die. Does that include me?
Don't forget, in the meantime, that this is the season for
strawberries. Yes.


 
 
 
 
The Passion according to G.H.
 
I keep looking, looking. Trying to understand. Trying to give
what I have gone through to someone else, and I don't know
who, but I don't want to be alone with that experience. I don't
know what to do with it, I'm terrified of that profound
disorganization. I'm not sure I even believe in what happened
to me. Did something happen, and did I, because I didn't
know how to experience it, end up experiencing something else
instead? It's that something that I'd like to call disorganization,
and then I'd have the confidence to venture forth because I
would know where to come back to: to the prior organization.
I prefer to call it disorganization because I don't want to
ground myself in what I experienced—in that grounding I would
lose the world as it was for me before, and I know that I
don't have the capacity for another one.
If I go ahead with that grounding and consider myself true, I'll
be lost because I won't know where to set up my new way of
being—if I go ahead with my fragmentary visions, the whole
world will have to change for me to fit into it.
Something's missing that once was essential to me and is so
no longer. I don't need it anymore, as though I had lost a
third leg that until then kept me from walking but made me a
stable tripod. It's that third leg that's now missing. And I've
gone back to being someone I never was. I've gone back to
having something I never had before: just my two legs. I know
that I can walk only when I have two legs. But I sense the
irrelevant loss of the third one, and it horrifies me, it was that
leg that made me able to find myself, and without even having
to look.
Am I disorganized because I have lost something I didn't even
need? In this new cowardice of mine—cowardice is what has
happened to me most recently, my greatest adventure, it is so
wide a field that only great courage enables me to accept it—in
my new cowardice, which is like waking up in the morning in
a stranger's house, I don't know if I'll have the courage simply
to set out. It's hard to lose oneself. So hard that I'll probably
soon work out a way of finding myself, even if finding myself
is again the lie that I live on. Up to now, finding myself was
having a ready-made person-idea and mounting myself inside it:
I incarnated myself inside that set-up person and didn't even
sense the great construction project that living was. The
person-idea that I had came from that third leg of mine, the
one that held me fast to the ground. But now . . . will I be
freer?
No! I know that I'm still not sensing freely, that once again
I'm thinking because my goal is to find—and that for safety's
sake I'll call the moment that I come across a way out
"finding." Why don't I have the courage to find just a way in?
Oh, I know that I have gone in. But I've been afraid because
I don't know where that way in leads. And I've never before
let myself go without knowing where.
Yesterday, however, I lost my human constitution for hours
and hours. If I'm brave, I'll let myself stay lost. But I'm afraid
of new things and I'm afraid to experience what I don't
understand—I always want the guarantee of at least thinking
that I understand, I don't know how to just give myself over
to disorientation. How do I explain that my greatest fear is
precisely in relation to ... to being? and that there is
nonetheless no other way to go. How to explain that my
greatest fear is precisely the fear of having to live out whatever
happens? how to explain that I cannot bear to look out, only
because life is not at all what I thought it was and is in fact
something other—as though I had known before what it was!
Why is it that just looking is so greatly disorganizing?
And disillusioning too. But what could I become disillusioned
about? if I was barely able to stand my merely constructed
organization without at least sensing? Maybe disillusionment is
the fear of no longer fitting into a system? It could, however,
be said that he is very happy who finally experiences
disillusionment. What I was before wasn't good for me. But it
was from that ungood that I put together something better: I
had put together hope. From my own ungood I had created a
future good. Am I now afraid that my new outlook won't
make sense? But why don't I just let myself be guided by
whatever happens? I shall have to run the holy risk of chance.
And replace fate with probability.
But are the discoveries of infancy like those made in a
laboratory, where one finds what one will? Was it, then, only
when I became an adult that I started to fear and grew the
third leg? Can I, as an adult, have the childlike courage to lose
myself? to lose oneself is to go looking with no sense of what
to do with what you might find. The two walking feet minus
that extra third one that holds a person down. And I want to
be held down. I don't know what to do with the horrifying
freedom that can destroy me. But while I was held down, was
I happy? Or was there—and there was—an uncanny, restless
something in my happy prison routine? Or was there—and
there was—that throbbing something to which I was so
accustomed that I thought throbbing was the same as being a
person? Isn't that it? yes, that too . . . that too ...
I become so scared when I realize that over a period of hours
I lost my human constitution. I don't know if I'll have another
one to replace the lost one with. I know that I'll need to take
care not to surreptitiously use a new third leg that can grow
back in me as easily as a weed, and then call that protective
leg "a truth."
But I also don't know what form to give to what happened to
me. And for me nothing exists unless I give it a form. And . .
. and what if the reality is precisely that nothing has existed?!
maybe nothing happened to me? I can understand only what
happens to me, but only what I understand happens . . . what
do I know about the rest? the rest hasn't existed. Maybe
nothing has existed! Maybe I have merely undergone a great,
slow disintegration. And my struggle against that disintegration
is just that: is just trying to give it a form. A form gives
contours to chaos, gives a construct to amorphous substance .
. . the vision of an infinite flesh is a madman's vision, but if I
cut that flesh into pieces and spread those pieces over days
and famines . . . then it will no longer be perdition and
madness: it will be humanized life again.
Humanized life. I had humanized life too much.
But what shall I do now? Shall I hold onto the whole vision,
even though it means holding onto an incomprehensible truth?
or shall I give form to nothingness and let that be my way of
integrating my very disintegration into myself? But I am so
poorly prepared to understand. Before, whenever I tried, my
limitations gave me a sensation of physical discomfort, in me,
any effort to think immediately runs up against my head. Early
on I had to recognize coldly the obstacle that my meager
intelligence represented and reject setting out on any path. I
knew that it was my fate to think little, reasoning power kept
me fast inside my own skin. How, then, could I now start
thinking? and maybe only thought could save me, I'm afraid of
passion.
Now that I have to save tomorrow, that I have to have a
form because I don't sense that I have the strength to stay
disorganized, now that, fatefully, I shall have to frame that
monstrous, infinite flesh and cut it into pieces that something
the size of my mouth can take in, and the size of my eyes'
vision, now that I shall fatefully succumb to the necessity of
form that comes from my fear of being undelimited—then let
me at least have the courage to let that form form by itself,
like a crust that hardens on its own, a fiery nebula that cools
into earth. And let me have the great courage to resist the
temptation to invent a form.
The effort that I shall now make to let a sense, whatever it
may be, rise to the surface, that effort could be made easier if
I pretended to write for someone.
But I'm afraid to start writing to be understood by that
imaginary someone, I'm afraid I'll start "making" a sense, with
the same meek madness that up to yesterday was my
"healthy" way of fitting into a system. Will I have to have the
courage to use an undefended heart and go on speaking to
nothing and no one? as when a child thinks about
nothingness. And to run the risk of being crushed by chance.
I don't understand what I saw. I don't even know if I saw it,
since my eyes ended up not being separate from what I saw.
Only in an unexpected rippling of the lines, only in an anomaly
in the uninterrupted continuity of my culture, did I for an
instant experience life-giving death. That purified death that
made me sort through the forbidden weft of life. Saying the
name of life is forbidden. And I almost said it. I almost
couldn't disentangle myself from its weft, which would have
been the destruction of my age inside me.
Perhaps what happened to me is an understanding . . . and
for me to be true, I have to continue being separate from it,
have to continue not understanding it. All sudden understanding
very closely approximates a clear nonunderstanding.
No. All sudden understanding is in the last analysis the
revelation of a clear nonunderstanding. Every moment of
finding is the losing of oneself. Perhaps I experienced an
understanding that was as complete as an ignoring, and I shall
emerge from it as intact and innocent as before. Any
comprehension on my part will never be equal to that
understanding, for I can reach only the height of living— the
only level on which I function is the level of living. Only now,
now I know of a secret. Which I am already forgetting; oh I
feel that I am already forgetting . . .
To rediscover it now I would have to die all over again. And
knowing it again could be the murder of my human soul. And
I don't want to, I don't want to. What could still save me
would be for me to deliver myself over to that new ignorance;
that would be possible. For all the while that I am struggling to
know, my new ignorance, which is forgetting, has become
sacred. I am the priestess of a secret that I no longer know.
And I serve out of blissful ignorance. I found out something I
was unable to understand, my lips became sealed, and I
retained only the incomprehensible fragments of a ritual.
Although for the first time I feel that my forgetting is, in the
last analysis, of a piece with the world. Oh, and I don't want
in the least to have anything explained to me that would have
to be made to go beyond itself to be explained. I don't want
anything explained to me that would require human validation
again for its interpretation.
Life and death have been mine, and I was a monstrosity. Mine
was the courage of the sleepwalker who simply acts. During
those hours of perdition, I had the courage neither to compose
nor to organize. And especially the courage not to look ahead.
Up to then I had not been brave enough to let myself be
guided by what I don't know toward what I don't know: my
foresight preconditioned what I would see. It wasn't the
foresight of seeing: it already had my care's dimensions about
it. My foresight closed the world to me.
Until, for a few hours, I stopped. And, my God, I got what I
didn't want. It wasn't a river valley I walked along—I had
always imagined that discovery would be fertile and humid, like
river valleys. I never thought it would be the immense
disencounter that it was.
Is my sacrifice for continuing to be human just forgetting? I
shall now be able to recognize in the common faces of some
people that. . . that they have forgotten. And that they no
longer know that they have forgotten what they have forgotten.
I saw it. I know I did because I didn't give it its meaning. I
know that I did because I don't understand it. I know I did
because what I saw isn't good for anything. Listen, I'm going
to have to talk because I don't know what to do with that
moment of living that I experienced. Worse yet: I don't like
what I saw. It explodes my day-to-day life. I apologize for
putting this all on you, I would have much preferred seeing
something better. Take what I experienced, free me from my
useless vision, from my useless sin.
I'm so frightened that I shall be able to accept the notion that
I have lost myself only if I imagine that someone is holding my
hand.
Putting my hand in someone else's has always been my
definition of happiness. Before I fall asleep, often—in that small
struggle not to lose consciousness and go into the greater
world—often, before I get up the courage to go into the
vastness of sleep, I pretend that someone has my hand in
theirs, and then I go, go to that enormous absence of form
that is sleep. And when even after that I don't have courage, I
dream.
Going to sleep is very much like the way that I now have of
going to my freedom. Giving myself over to something I don't
understand is placing myself on the brink of nothingness. It is
going just by going, like a blindwoman lost in a field. That
supernatural thing that is living. The living that I had tamed
and made familiar. That courageous thing that is for me to
give myself over and is like reaching out a hand to God's
ghostly hand and entering that formless thing that is a
paradise. A paradise that I don't want!
During the time I'm writing and speaking, I'm going to have to
pretend that someone is holding my hand.
Oh, at least at the beginning . . . only at the beginning. As
soon as I can do without it, I'll go on alone. In the meantime,
I need to hold this hand of yours—even if I can't picture your
face and your eyes and your mouth. But even though it is cut
off from a body, this hand doesn't scare me. Its creation
comes from an idea of love such that it is as if the hand were
really attached to a body, and if I don't see it it's because I
am unable to love more. I'm not up to picturing a whole
person because I'm not a whole person myself. And how can I
imagine a face if I don't know what kind of expression I need
on it? As soon as I can get along without your warm hand,
I'll go on alone—and in terror. That terror will be my
responsibility until the metamorphosis is complete and the terror
is transformed into clarity. Not the clarity born of a desire for
beauty and morality like the kind I looked for before even
without knowing it, but rather the natural clarity of what exists,
and it is that natural clarity that terrifies me. Even though I
know that the terror . . . the terror is only myself coming face
to face with things.
In the meantime, I am inventing your presence, just as one
day I shall also be unable to let myself die alone, dying is the
greatest peril of all, I won't be able to pass over into death
and put my first foot into my first self-absence— in that last
and so first an hour too I shall invent your nameless presence
and with you I shall start to die until I am able on my own
not to exist, and then I'll let you go. For now, I have you,
and your warm, unknown life is my only internal organization,
I who without your hand would feel unattached within the
enormous space that I have discovered. The space of truth?
But the fact is that truth has never made sense to me. Truth
doesn't make sense! That's why I was afraid of it, and still am.
Forsaken as I am, I give everything over to you—so you can
do something pleasant with it. If I talk to you will I frighten
you and lose you? but if I don't, I'll lose myself and in losing
myself lose you anyhow.
Truth doesn't make sense, the hugeness of the world makes
me shrink. What I probably asked for and finally found still
ended up leaving me unprepared, like a child walking alone
across the earth. So unprepared that only my love of all the
universe could console me and satisfy me, only a love such
that the very egg-cell of things would resonate with what I call
love. With what in fact I am merely naming without knowing
its name.
Could it have been love that I saw? But what kind of love is it
that is as blind as an egg-cell? is that what it was? that terror,
was it . . . love? a love so neutral that— no, I don't want to
talk to myself anymore, to talk would be to precipitate a sense
just like making yourself suddenly stable with the paralyzing
security of that third leg. Or am I simply putting off starting to
talk? why am I saying nothing and just playing for time?
Because I'm afraid. I need courage to go forth with an attempt
to concretize what I feel. It's as though I possessed a coin and
didn't know what country it was good in.
I shall need courage to do what I'm going to do: to talk. And
to run the risk of the enormous surprise that I am going to
feel at the poverty of what I say. As soon as I say it, I'll have
to add: "That isn't it, that isn't it at all!" But I'll also need not
to be afraid of being foolish, I've always gone for the less
rather than the more for fear of seeming foolish along the
way: and also there's the wounding of one's dignity. I'm putting
off the moment when I have to talk. Is it because I'm afraid?
And because I don't have a word to say.
I don't have a word to say. Why don't I just stay quiet, then?
But if I don't force myself to talk, silence will forever engulf me
in waves. Word and form will be the plank on top of which I
shall float over billows of silence.
And if I keep putting off starting, it's also because I have no
guide. Other travelers' accounts give me few facts about the
trip: all their information is horribly incomplete.
I feel that an incipient freedom is gradually taking me over. . .
. For never before today have I had so little fear of lacking
good taste: I just wrote "billows of silence," which I wouldn't
have said before because I have always respected beauty and
its intrinsic decorum. I have said "billows of silence," my heart
humbly bows, and I accept it. Have I in effect abandoned a
whole system of good taste? But is that my only gain? How
imprisoned I must have been that I feel myself freer just
because I no longer fear a lack of aesthetics. ... I still don't
foresee what else I may have gained. Maybe I'll learn of it little
by little. For now, the first timid pleasure that I feel is being
able to say that I have lost my fear of the ugly. And that loss
is a very great good. It is a delight.
I want to know what more I've gained by losing. As of now, I
don't know: only in reliving it will I experience it.
But how can I relive it? If I don't have a normal word to say.
Shall I have to make words as though I were creating what
happened to me?
I am going to create what happened to me. Only because
living isn't tellable. Living isn't livable. I shall have to create
upon life. And without lying. Yes to creation, no to lying.
Creation isn't imagination, it's running the huge risk of coming
face to face with reality. Understanding is a creation, it's my
only way. I shall have to painstakingly translate telegraph
signals—translate the unknown into a language that I don't
know, and not even understand what the signals amount to. I
shall speak in that sleep-walker's language that if I were awake
wouldn't even be a language.
And I'll create the truth of what happened to me. Oh, it will
be more a graphism than a writing, since I shall be engaging
in reproduction rather than expression. I need to express
myself less all the time. Have I lost that as well? No, even
when I did sculpture I was only reproducing, and only with my
hands.
Will I stay lost amid the silence of the signals? I will, for I
know what I'm like: I never learned to look without needing
more than just to see. I know that I'll terrify myself like
someone who was blind and then finally opened her eyes and
saw—but saw what? a mute, incomprehensible triangle. Couldn't
that person consider herself blinder still for seeing only an
incomprehensible triangle?
I ask myself: if I look into the darkness with a magnifying
glass, will I see more than darkness? the glass won't disperse
the darkness, it will only reveal it all the more. And if I look at
brightness with a magnifying glass, I shall see, with a shock,
only greater brightness. I have seen but am as blind as before
because I saw an incomprehensible triangle. Unless I also
transform myself into a triangle that will see in the
incomprehensible triangle my own source and repetition.
I'm stalling. I know that everything I say is just to put it off—
to put off the moment when I'll have to start talking, knowing
that there is nothing more for me to say. I'm putting off my
silence. Have I been putting off silence for my whole life? but
now, in my disparagement of the word, perhaps I'll finally be
able to start talking.
The telegraph signals. The world bristling with antennas, and
here am I receiving the signal. I'll be able to do only a
phonetic transcription. Three thousand years ago I lost my
head, and all that was left were phonetic fragments of me. I'm
blinder than before. I did see, I really did. And I was terrified
by the raw truth of a world whose greatest horror is that it is
so alive that for me to admit that I am as alive as it is—and
my most hideous discovery is that I am as alive as it is—I
shall have to raise my consciousness of life outside to so high
a point that it would amount to a crime against my personal
life.
For the profound morality that I felt before—my morality was
the desire to understand, and, since I didn't understand, I
shuffled things around, that was only yesterday, and now that I
discover that I have always been profoundly moral: I admit
only of finality—as for my prior profound morality, for me to
discover that I am as crudely alive as that bare light that I
learned of yesterday, as for that morality of mine, the harsh
glory of being alive is horror itself. I lived before of a
humanized world; did the simply alive destroy the morality that
I had then?
A world wholly alive has a Hellish power.
 
 
A world wholly alive has a Hellish power.
Yesterday morning—when I went out of the dining room to the
maid's room—I had no way of knowing that I was but a step
away from discovering an empire. Just a step away. My more
primary struggle for more primary life was about to open with
the calm, voracious ferocity of desert animals. I was about to
confront within myself a degree of living so originary that it
bordered on the inanimate. Nothing I was doing, however, gave
any hint that I, my lips dry with thirst, was going to begin to
exist.
It was only afterward that an old phrase would occur to me,
one that years before I had foolishly engraved in my memory,
just the subtitle of a magazine article that I ended up not
reading: "Lost in the Fiery Hell of a Canyon a Woman
Desperately Struggles for Life." I had no way of foreseeing
where I was headed. But then I never was able to see how
things were leaning; every time they reached a culmination, it
always seemed to me to be a surprising rupture, an abrupt
explosion, at a specific moment, and not the continuation of an
uninterrupted flow.
That morning, before I went into the maid's room, what was
I? I was what others had always seen me as, and that was
the way I knew myself. I don't know how to explain what I
was. But at least I want to remember: what was I doing?
It was almost ten in the morning, and it had been a long time
since my apartment had been so much my own. The maid
had quit the day before. The fact that there was no one
talking or walking around and making something happen
magnified with its silence this dwelling in which I live in my
semiluxury. I was lingering at the coffee table— how hard it is
becoming to know what I was like. But I have to make the
effort to at least give myself a prior form, so I can understand
what happened when I lost that form.
I was lingering over the coffee table, making little balls out of
the center of the bread—is that right? I need to know, I need
to know what I was like! This is how I was: I was distractedly
making little, round balls out of the heart of the bread, and
my last, tranquil, amorous liaison had dissolved amicably, with a
caress, and I had again come into the happy and lightly insipid
pleasure of freedom. Does that situate me? I am pleasant, I
have sincere friendships, and my awareness of that gives me a
gladsome friendship with myself that has never excluded a
certain self-directed irony, albeit one that I don't push very far.
But . . . what that silence of mine was like before I don't
know and have never discovered. Sometimes, while looking at a
snapshot taken at the beach or at a party, I would notice, with
a slight, ironic apprehension, what that smiling, dimmed face
showed about me: a silence. A silence and a destiny that were
escaping me, me a hieroglyphic fragment of an empire living or
dead. Looking at the picture I could see the mystery. No. I'm
going to lose the rest of my fear of bad taste, I'm going to
start my exercise in courage, living isn't courage, knowing that
you're living, that's courage—and I swear that in the
photograph of me I could see the Mystery. I would be taken
slightly by surprise, it's only now that I am discovering that it
was a surprise: in those smiling eyes there was a silence such
as I have seen only in lakes and heard only in silence itself.
Never, then, did I have reason to think that one day I would
go to encounter that silence. To encounter the splintering of
silence. I would take a quick glance at the face in the
photograph and, for a second, in that inexpressive face the
world would look equally inexpressively back at me. Was
that—just that—my closest contact with myself? the greatest
silent sounding I have attained, my blindest, most direct link
with the world. The rest . . . the rest amounted to various
organizations of myself, I know that now, oh now I know. The
rest was how I had transformed myself little by little into the
person who bears my name. And I ended up being my name.
All you need to do is see the initials G. H. in the leather of
my luggage to know that that's me. And I have never
demanded of anyone else anything more than the mere
coverage of the initials of their names. What is more,
"psychology" has never held any interest for me. I used to
become impatient, and still do, with the psychological attitude;
it's an instrument that simply transcends. I think I left the
psychological stage behind with adolescence.
G. H. had lived a great deal, that is, had experienced many
facts. Have I somehow perhaps been in a hurry to experience
everything I would have to experience as soon as possible, so
that I would have extra time to ... to live without facts? to live.
Did I early on discharge all my sense duties—early and quickly
experience pains and pleasures—to get free all the sooner of
my lesser human destiny? to get free so that I could seek my
tragedy.
My tragedy lay somewhere. Where was my greater destiny?
one that wasn't just the plot of my life. The tragedy—which is
the greater adventure—had never taken place in me. My
personal destiny was all I knew. And all I wanted to know.
I spread about me a tranquility that comes from my having
reached a certain degree of realization about what it means to
be G. H., even on luggage. Also, without reflection, I have
adopted my reputation for my so-called inner life: I treat myself
as others treat me, I am what others see in me. When I was
alone there was no fall-off, there was merely one degree less
of what I was like with the others, and that was always my
naturalness and my health. And my brand of beauty. Was it
only my photographs that pictured an abyss? an abyss.
An abyss of nothingness. Just that huge, empty thing: abyss.
I act like what is referred to as a finished person. Intermittent
sculpting over an indeterminate period of time also gave me a
past and a present that allowed others to situate me: they
allude to me as someone who does sculptures that wouldn't be
bad if they were less amateurish. For a woman, that reputation
is a great thing socially and it has located me, as much for
myself as for others, in an area between man and woman,
socially speaking. Which left me much freer to be a woman,
since I was making no formal effort to be one.
As regards my so-called inner life, perhaps it was the sporadic
sculpting that has given it a slight tone of pre-climax—perhaps
because of that certain kind of attentiveness that even
dilettantish art brings with it. Or because I have had the
experience of patiently clearing away material to find gradually
its immanent sculpture; or because, again from the sculpture, I
have suffered the enforced objectivity of struggling with
something that was other than myself.
All this has given me the slight tone of preclimax characteristic
of someone who knows that, if I listen attentively to objects,
something of those objects will come forth and be imparted to
me that will then in turn be given back to the objects. Maybe
it was that tone of preclimax that I saw in the smiling, ghostly
photograph of a face whose voice is an inexpressive silence, all
people's pictures are portraits of the Mona Lisa.
And is that all I can say about myself? That I'm "sincere"? I
am, more or less. I don't lie to conjure up false truths. But I
have used truths as a pretext too much. Truth as a pretext
for lying? I could just tell myself things that flattered me and
then tell the underside. But I have to be careful not to confuse
defects with truths. I am afraid of what being sincere would
lead me to: to my so-called nobility, which I pass over, to my
so-called vulgarity, with which I do likewise. The more sincere I
might become, the more I'll be led to flatter myself, both with
my occasional nobilities and especially with my occasional
vulgarity. The only thing sincerity doesn't lead me to do is
pride myself on my inconsequentiality. That I leave out
altogether and not just for lack of self-pardon, I who have
pardoned every great and important thing in myself.
Inconsequentiality I omit because confession is often a point of
vanity for me, even painful confession.
It isn't that I want to be pure of vanity, but I need to clear
myself from the field to be able to move in it. If I can move.
Or is wanting not to be subject to vanity the worst form of
vanity itself? No, I think I just need to be able to look without
having the color of my eyes matter. I need to get rid of myself
to be able to see.
And is that all I was? When I open my door to unexpected
visitors, what I glimpse in the faces of the people who see me
at the door is that they have just glimpsed in me my tender
preclimax. What the others get from me is, then, reflected back
to form the atmosphere of what is called "me." That preclimax
may have been my whole existence up to now. The
other—anonymous and unknown— that other existence of mine
that was merely profound was what probably gave me the
sense of security of a person who always has the kettle on a
low flame in the kitchen: whatever occasion might arise, I'd
always have water boiling.
Only the water had never boiled. I didn't need violence, I just
bubbled about enough to keep the water from ever boiling and
overflowing. No, I haven't known violence. I was born without
a mission, my nature didn't impart one to me; and I have
always had a light enough hand not to impress a role upon
myself. I didn't give myself a role, but I did organize myself for
the purposes of my own understanding. I couldn't put up with
not finding myself in the catalog. My question, if I had one,
wasn't "what am I?" but rather "among whom am I?" My
cycle was complete: what I was experiencing in the present
had already been conditioned in such a way that I could
understand myself as a result. An eye looked over my life. I
probably called that eye sometimes "truth," sometimes morality,
sometimes human law, sometimes "God," sometimes "myself."
For the most part I lived inside a mirror. Two minutes after I
was born I had already lost my beginnings.
A step away from the climax, a step away from the revolution,
a step away from what is called love. A step away from my
life—which, because of a kind of strong reverse magnet, I
wasn't making into a life; and also because of a will to order.
Life's disorder is bad taste. And even I wouldn't have known
how to transform that latent step away into a real step if I
had wanted to. Because of pleasure in a harmonious
coherence, because of the greedy, ever-promising pleasure of
holding and not having to put out—I didn't need the climax,
the revolution, or even that prelove that is so much happier
than love itself. Was the promise all I needed? Yes, just a
promise.
Maybe that attitude—or lack of attitude—also came from the
fact that never having married or borne children I haven't, so
to speak, had to wear any shackles, or break any: I've been
continuously free. Being continuously free has been helped
along by my facile nature: I eat and drink and sleep facile.
And of course my freedom has also come from my financial
independence.
I suppose my habit of thinking only at the moment when it is
necessary came from my sculpture, for it taught me to think
only with my hands and only at the time of using them. Also
from my intermittent sculpting came my habit of pleasure, to
which I already tended by nature: my eyes had handled the
form of things so much that I became more and more
accustomed to pleasure and rooted myself in it. I could, with
much less than my whole self, I could work with anything: just
like yesterday at the coffee table, where all I needed to form
round forms from the bread heart was the surface of my
fingers and the surface of the bread. To do what I could do I
had never needed either suffering or talent. What I had in my
power wasn't for me a conquest, it was a natural gift.
And among women and men, what was I? I have always had
an extremely tender admiration for male habits and ways of
doing things and take an unurgent pleasure in being female,
being female was also a natural gift for me. I've only had a
facility for such gifts and not the awe of any vocation—I think
that's it, isn't it?
From the table over which I was lingering because I had time,
I looked around, while my fingers were making the bread heart
into balls. The world was a strange place.
Which allowed me to live: in the world I could stick one little
ball of bread heart to another, I just needed to put one beside
the other and then all I had to do was push them together,
with very little effort, just enough for one surface to adhere to
the other, that way, pleasurefully, I was making a curious
pyramid that gave me pleasure: a right triangle made of round
forms, a form made up of forms opposite to itself. If that had
any meaning for me, the bread heart and my fingers probably
knew what it was.
The apartment reflects me. It's on the top floor, which is
considered elegant. People in my circle try to live in the
so-called penthouse. It's more than elegant. It's a real pleasure:
you can command a city from up here. When that elegance
becomes common, will I, without even thinking why, move to
another kind of elegance? Maybe. Just like me, the apartment
has moist lights and shadows, nothing here is sharp: one room
precedes and anticipates the next. From my dining room I
could see the mixture of shadows that formed a prelude to the
living room. Everything here is the elegant, ironic, witty riposte
of a life that has never existed anywhere: my home is merely
an artistic creation.
In fact, everything here refers to a life that, if it were real,
would little serve me. What does it trace out, then? If it were
real, I wouldn't understand it, but I enjoy the copy and
understand it. The copy is very pretty. The circle of artistic
and semiartistic people that I live in should, however, make me
disdain copies; but I have always seemed to prefer parody, it
has served me well. Tracing a life probably gave me—or does
it still? to what extent has the harmony of my past life
exploded?—tracing a life probably gave me a sense of security
precisely because the life wasn't mine: it wasn't a responsibility
that I had to deal with.
The slight, generalized pleasure—which seems to have been the
tone in which I live, or lived—has perhaps come from the fact
that the world was neither me nor mine: I could take pleasure
in it. Just as I had not made men mine either and could
therefore admire and sincerely love them, as one loves
nonegotistically, as one loves an idea. Since they were not mine,
I never tortured them.
As one loves an idea. My home's witty elegance comes from
the fact that everything here is in quotation marks. To be
honest about true authorship, I cite the world, I have
repeatedly cited it, since it was neither me nor mine. Was
beauty, a certain land of beauty, my object, as it is for
everyone? did I live in beauty?
As for myself, without either lying or telling the truth—just as
in that moment yesterday morning when I was sitting at the
coffee table—as for myself, I have always kept one quotation
mark to my left and another to my right. In a certain sense,
"as if it wasn't me" was wider than if it was—a nonexistent life
completely possessed me, occupied me like an invention. Only
in the photograph, when the negative was developed, was there
something else developed as well—something which, not
accomplished by me, was accomplished by the snapshot: when
the negative was printed it showed my ectoplasmic presence. Is
photography the portrait of a concavity, of a lack, of an
absence?
All the while I was, more than just clean and correct, I was a
pretty riposte. For all that is probably what makes me pretty
and generous. A man of experience has only to glance at me
to tell that here is a woman of grace and generosity, one who
is no bother, who doesn't tear a man down: a woman who
smiles and laughs. I respect others' pleasure, and I take my
own pleasure delicately, tedium nourishes me and delicately
consumes me, the sweet tedium of a honeymoon.
That image of myself between quotation marks used to satisfy
me, and not just superficially. I was the image of what I
wasn't, and that image of my nonbeing fulfilled me entirely:
one of the strongest ways of being is to be negatively. Since I
didn't know what I was, "nonbeing" was my closest
approximation to truth: at least I controlled the flip side: I at
least had the "non," I had my opposite. What was good for
me I didn't then know; I experienced, with some pre-fervor,
what was bad for me.
And in experiencing that "bad," I experienced the backside of
what I couldn't even try to want or to attempt. Just like
someone who leads a life of "depravity" with peril and love
and at least has the opposite of what she neither knows nor
wants nor can achieve: the life of a nun. Only now do I know
that I had everything in my hands, though in a backward way:
I was dedicating myself to every detail on the non side.
Through nonbeing in detail, I proved to myself that—that I was.
That manner of nonbeing was much more pleasant, much
cleaner: for, with no irony now, I am a woman of spirit. And
of spirited body. At the coffee table, I was framing myself in
my white robe, my clean, well-sculpted face, and my simple
body. From me there irradiated the kind of dignity that comes
from indulgence in one's own pleasures and in others'
pleasures. I was delicately consuming my own and delicately
wiping my mouth with the napkin.
That her, G. H. in the luggage leather, was me; is it. . . still?
No! Hence I calculate that the hardest thing my vanity will
have to face will be my own judgment: I shall-have all the
appearance of one who has experienced failure, and only I
shall know if it was requisite failure.
 
 
 
Only I shall know if it was requisite failure.
I arose at last from the coffee table, that woman. Since there
was no maid that day, I would be engaging in the sort of
activity I liked most: cleaning up. I've always liked putting
things in their places. I think it's my only true calling. By
ordering things I create and understand at the same time. But
since, through reasonably well-placed investments, I have
gradually become pretty well-off, I've been kept from putting
that calling into practice: if I hadn't belonged to the class that I
do by reason of both money and culture, I would normally
have had a domestic's job in some rich people's great house,
where there is a great deal to put in order. Ordering is finding
the best form. If I had been a domestic like that, I wouldn't
even have needed my dilettantish sculpture; if I could have
liberally ordered with my hands. Ordered form itself?
I found the ever-forbidden pleasure of putting a house in order
so great that even while I sat at the table, I had already
begun to take pleasure in the mere planning of it. I looked out
around the apartment: where should I start?
Also because afterward, at the seventh hour, just as on the
seventh day, I'd be free to rest and have the remainder of a
day in repose. Repose almost without joy, which would be a
good balance for me: from my hours of sculpture I had
learned almost joyless calm. I had enjoyed myself too much the
last week, had gone out too much, had had too much of
whatever I wanted, and I now wanted the day to be exactly as
it promised to be: toilsome and empty and good. I would
make it go as long as possible.
Maybe I'd start by organizing the back of the apartment: the
maid's room was probably filthy, what with its dual function of
sleeping quarters and storeroom for old suitcases and clothes,
back newspapers, leftover wrapping paper and string. I'd get it
clean and ready for the new maid. Then, from that end of the
apartment, I would progress slowly, "climbing" horizontally to
the opposite end, the living room, where—as though I myself
were the finishing point of the cleaning and of the morning—I
would stretch out on the sofa and read the newspaper,
probably drowsing in the process. If the telephone didn't ring.
With that in mind, I decided to take the phone off the hook,
to be sure that I wouldn't be bothered by anything.
How can I now explain that at that very moment I had begun
to see something that would become clear only later? without
knowing it I was now in the antechamber of the room. I had
begun to see and I didn't know it; I had seen since I was
born and I didn't yet know it, I didn't know it.
Give me your anonymous hand, for life is giving me pain and
I don't know how to go on talking—reality is too delicate, only
reality is delicate, my unreality and my imagination are more
substantial.
Having decided to start my ordering in the maid's room, I
went through the kitchen, which leads to the service area. At
the end of the service area the hallway starts that leads to the
maid's room. Before going on, however, I leaned against the
wall in the service area to finish smoking my cigarette.
I looked down: thirteen floors of building below. I didn't know
that all of it was already playing a part in what was going to
happen. The process had probably begun a thousand times
before and had then been led astray. This time it would go all
the way to its end, and I didn't foresee it at all.
I looked at the inside area, the backs of all the apartments, for
which my own apartment too existed as a back. On the
outside, my building was white, with the smoothness of marble
and the smoothness of finished surface. But on the inside, the
inside area was a chaotic jumble of square blocks, windows,
dark streaks and blotches from the rain, window snarling at
window, mouths looking into mouths. My building's mass was
like a factory's. The miniature of a vast landscape of passages
and canyons: smoking there, as though on a mountaintop, I
looked out over the view, probably with the same inexpressive
gaze that could be seen in the photographs of me.
I saw what all of that expressed: it all expressed nothing. And
I took in that nothing with great attentiveness, took it in with
what was in my eyes in those pictures; only now do I know
that I was continuously receiving that silent signal. I looked
down at the inside area. All of it had an inanimate richness
about it that recalled the richness of nature itself: here you
could also prospect for uranium and from here oil could gush
forth.
I was seeing what only later would I feel—I mean, only later
would I experience a profound loss of meaning. Only later
would I understand: what seems a lack of meaning ... is what
meaning there is. Every instant of "lack of meaning" is precisely
the frightening certainty that it is there that meaning lies and
that I not only can't reach it but don't want to because there
are no guarantees. Only later would the lack of meaning
besiege me. Could a sense of the lack of meaning have always
been my negative mode of sensing meaning? it had been my
participation.
What I was seeing in the monstrous, machine insides that was
the inside area of my building, what I was seeing were things
that had been made, eminently practical things with practical
purposes.
But something of terrible, general nature—which I would later
experience within myself—something of fateful nature had
fatefully come forth from the hands of the hundred practical
workmen who had installed water and drainpipes, wholly
unaware that they were constructing this Egyptian ruin at
which I was now staring with the stare that was in the
photographs of me on the beach. Only later would I know that
I had seen: only later, after seeing the secret, did I realize that
I had already seen it.
I tossed the lighted cigarette over the edge and took a step
back, slyly hoping that no neighbor would link me to that act
prohibited by the Building Management. After a moment, I
carefully stuck my head out and looked down: I couldn't even
tell where the cigarette had landed. The precipice had silently
swallowed it up. Was I thinking then? at least I was thinking
about nothing. Or maybe about the possibility that some
neighbor had seen me commit that forbidden act, which didn't
go at all with the cultured woman that I was pictured as being,
which made me smile.
Then I went up the dark hallway that leads to the service
area.
 
 
 
 
I went up the dark hallway that leads to the service area.
In that hallway, which forms the very back of the apartment,
two doors face each other, indistinct in the shadows: the
service exit and the door to the maid's quarters. The outback
of my home. I opened the door to the expectation of stacks of
newspapers and a dark pile of storage and junk.
But as I opened the door, I had to squint in reaction and in
physical revulsion.
Instead of the jumbled shadows that I was expecting, I
encountered the vision of a room that was a quadrangle of
white light; my eyes squinted in self-protection.
For the past almost six months —the length of time that maid
had been with me—I had not ventured in there, and my
astonishment came from finding a completely clean room.
I had expected to find dark corners, I had prepared myself to
have to throw the window wide open and bathe musty
darkness with fresh air. What I hadn't expected was that the
maid, without saying anything to me, had fixed the room up
the way she wanted it, and, acting as though she owned it
herself, had done away with its function as a storage area.
From the doorway I now looked in on a room that had about
it a calm, empty order. Without telling me, the maid had
opened up a dry, empty space in my fresh, cozy, moist home.
What I had now was a room that was completely clean and
shiny, like a room in an insane asylum from which all
dangerous objects have been removed.
Here, now, because of the space that had been created, were
concentrated the reverberations from the roofs, from the
cement terraces, from the erect antennae of all the neighboring
buildings, from the reflections of a thousand building windows.
The room seemed to occupy a level much higher than that of
the rest of the apartment.
Like a minaret. My first impression of a minaret began with
this room: free-floating above a limitless expanse. At the time, I
perceived only my physical discomfort with that impression.
The sides of the room weren't uniform: two of the angles were
slightly greater than square. And while that was its physical
reality, it descended upon me as though it was my own vision
that was deforming it. It seemed like a paper representation of
how I might perceive a four-sided figure: already deformed in
its lines of perspective. The concretization of a flaw in vision,
the materialization of an optical illusion. Its not being entirely
regular in its angles gave it an appearance of basic fragility, as
though this minaret of a room were not attached to either the
apartment or the building.
From the door I could see the sharp line of the sun cutting
off half the ceiling and a third of the floor with black shadow.
Six months of permanent sun had warped the pine wardrobe
and denuded the whitewashed walls to even greater whiteness.
And it was on one of the walls that, recoiling in surprise and
revulsion, I saw the unexpected mural.
On the whitewashed wall by the door—that's why I hadn't seen
them before—were charcoal outlines, in about life size, of a
nude man, a nude woman, and a dog more nude than dogs
really are. What the nudity disclosed was not drawn in on the
bodies, the nudity came merely from the absence of all
covering: they were the shapes of empty nudity. The lines were
thick, made with a broken-tipped piece of charcoal. In places
they were doubled, as though one line were the mark of the
other's trembling. A dry trembling by dry charcoal.
The lines' rigidity fixed the outsized, crazy figures to the wall
like three automatons. Even the dog had the tame insanity of
something that is not powered by a force of its own. The
clumsiness of the overbold lines made the dog seem to me
something solid and petrified, set more in itself than on the
wall.
After I got over the initial surprise of finding this hidden mural
in my own home, I looked more closely, now with amused
surprise, at these isolated figures on the wall. The simplified feet
didn't quite touch the floor line, the small heads didn't reach
the ceiling line, and that, along with the stupid rigidity of the
lines, gave the three isolated figures the appearance of three
mummies. As the figures' harsh motionlessness bothered me
more and more, the notion of mummies grew stronger and
stronger. They stood out as though they had gradually oozed
forth from the inside of the wall, had slowly come from the
core, finally reaching the harsh lime surface.
None of the figures was touching, and the three didn't form a
group: each figure stared straight ahead, as though it had
never looked sideways, as though it had never seen any of the
others and had no idea that anyone existed beside it.
I gave a constrained smile, I was trying to smile: because each
figure was there on the wall, just as I was there, standing rigid
in the doorway. The drawing was not a decoration, it was
writing.
I was assailed by a recollection of the absent maid. I tried to
remember her face, and was amazed that I could not—she had
been able to exclude me so completely from my own home
that it was as if she had closed the door on me and left me
far from my own lodging. Recollection of her features escaped
me, it must be just a temporary lapse.
But her name ... of course, of course I remembered, finally: it
was Janair. And, looking at this hieratic drawing, I suddenly
realized that Janair had hated me. I looked at the figures of
the man and the woman, with the palms of their vibrant
hands up and open, and they seemed to have been left there
by Janair as a crude message for when I would open the
door.
My discomfort was somehow amusing; had it never occurred
to me that in Janair's silence there might have been a criticism
of my life-style, which her silence must have labeled "a man's
life"? how had she thought of me?
I looked at the drawing on the wall in which I was probably
being portrayed ... I, the Man. And the dog . . . was that the
name she was calling me? For years I had been judged only
by my peers and by my own circle, which were, in the final
analysis, made by myself for myself. Janair was the first outside
person whose gaze I really took notice of.
Suddenly, with, now, real discomfort, I finally allowed there to
come over me a sensation that, through negligence and lack of
interest, I had for a good six months not allowed myself to
have: the sensation of that woman's silent hatred. What
surprised me was that it was a kind of free hate, the worst
kind of hate: indifferent hate. Not a hate that individualized me
but just the absence of all compassion. No, not even hate.
That was when I unexpectedly succeeded in remembering her
face, but, of course, how could I have forgotten it? I pictured
again her quiet, black face, pictured her completely opaque skin
that seemed more like one of her ways of being silent,
extremely well defined eyebrows, I pictured again the fine,
delicate features that were barely discernible on the faded
blackness of her skin.
The features —I discovered with no pleasure—were a queen's
features. And her posture as well: her body, erect, slim, hard,
smooth, almost fleshless, with no breasts, or ass. And her
clothes? It wasn't surprising that I had used her as though she
had no presence: under her small apron she always wore dark
brown or black, which made her all dark and invisible—I
shivered to discover that till now I hadn't noticed that that
woman was an invisible woman. Janair had what was almost
only an external form, the features within that form were so
refined that they barely existed: she was flattened out like a
bas-relief frozen on a piece of wood.
And was it inevitable that just as she herself was, so she saw
me? abstracting everything unessential from the body that was
me drawn on the wall and also seeing only my outlines.
Curiously, however, the figure on the wall still reminded me of
someone: myself. Besieged by the presence of herself that
Janair had left in a room in my home, I noticed that the three
angular zombie figures had in fact kept me from going in, as
though the room were still being occupied.
I hesitated at the door.
Also because the room's unexpected simplicity disoriented me:
in fact I wouldn't even know where to start cleaning up, or
even if it was necessary.
I looked about, dispirited, at the minaret's nakedness:
The bed, from which the bedding had been stripped, had its
dusty cloth mattress exposed, with big, faded blotches like from
sweat or watery blood, old, pale blotches. Here and there,
strands of thick horsehair came through the cloth, which was
so dry it was rotten, and they stood straight up in the air.
Along one of the walls, three old suitcases were stacked in so
perfect a symmetrical order that I had just now perceived their
presence, since they didn't change at all the sense of the
room's emptiness. On them, and on the almost effaced mark
of a "G. H.," a silent, sedimented accumulation of dust.
And then there was the narrow wardrobe: it had only one
door and was as tall as a person of my height. The wood,
continually dried out by the sun, had broken open in slits and
cracks. Had that Janair never closed the window? She, even
more than I, had taken advantage of the view from the
"penthouse."
The room was so different from the rest of the apartment that
going into it was like leaving my own home and entering
another. The room was the opposite of what I had created in
my home, the opposite of the gentle beauty that came from
my talent for arrangement, from my talent for living, the
opposite of my serene irony, my sweet, disinterested irony: it
was a violation of my quotation marks, the quotation marks
that made me a reference to myself. The room was the
portrait of an empty stomach.
And nothing there had been done by me. In the rest of the
apartment the sun filtered in from the outside in soft beam
after soft beam, the result of the interaction of heavy curtains
and light curtains. But here the sun didn't seem to come from
outside to inside: this seemed to be the place where the sun
itself was, fixed and unmoving, with a harsh light, as though
the room didn't close its eyes, even at night. Everything here
was dissected nerves that had had their ends dried into wire. I
had been prepared to clean up a mess, but this struggle with
its absence disoriented me.
I noticed at that point that I was irritated. The room bothered
me physically, as though the sound of the scratching of dry
charcoal on the dried whitewash still hung in the air. The
room's inaudible sound was like the sound of a needle going
around on a record after the music had finished playing. It
was the neutral thing-screeching that made up the matter of its
silence. Charcoal and fingernails together, charcoal and
fingernails, calm, compact fury on the part of the woman who
was the representative of a silence as if she represented a
foreign country, the African queen. And she had taken up
lodging here in my home, that stranger, that indifferent enemy.
I asked myself if Janair had in fact hated me—or if it had
been I who had hated her, without even looking at her. Just
as I was now discovering with irritation that the room didn't
just irritate me, I detested it, that cubicle with nothing but
surfaces: its innards had dried and shriveled up. I looked
around me with repulsion and despair.
Until I forced myself to take heart . . . and a certain violence:
all this would have to be changed this very day.
The first thing that I'd do would be to haul down the hallway
the few things that were left in the room. Then I would throw
bucket after bucket of water into the empty room and let the
harsh air drink it up, and finally I would wet down the dust
until some moisture came into that desert, destroying the
minaret that so haughtily topped a horizon of roofs. Then I
would throw water onto the wardrobe, swamp it in a flood up
to mouth-level—and then, then watch the wood start to rot. An
unexplainable anger, but one that had come over me
completely naturally, had taken hold: I wanted to kill something
here.
And then, then I would cover that dry-straw mattress with a
soft, cold, clean sheet, one of my own sheets with my initials
embroidered on it, to replace the one that Janair must have
thrown into the wash.
But before all else I would scrape that granulated carbon
dessication off the wall, scratching the dog off with a knife
blade, erasing the man's hands with the turned-out palms,
destroying the undersized head of that hideous naked woman.
And I would throw water and more water until it ran in
streams down the clean-scraped wall.
As though I were looking at a photograph of the room after I
had changed it back into mine and into me, I gave a sigh of
relief.
Then I went in.
How can I explain it except that something was happening that
I don't understand. What did that woman who was me really
want? what was happening to a G. H. in luggage leather?
Nothing, nothing, it was just that my nerves were now on
edge—my nerves that had been calm, or just organized? had
my silence really been a silence, or a loud voice that is mute?
How can I explain it to you? Suddenly that whole world that
was me was contracting from exhaustion, I couldn't stand
carrying it on my shoulders any longer . . . it, what? and I
gave in to a tension that had always been there but I didn't
know it. At that time there were beginning to take place in
me—and still I didn't know it—the first signs of the collapse of
subterranean limestone caves that were falling in under the
weight of stratified archaeological layers—and the force of the
first collapse lowered the corners of my mouth, made my arms
fall. What was happening to me? I shall never be able to
understand it, but there must be someone who can. And I
shall have to create that someone who can inside myself.
In spite of having come into the room, I seemed to have come
into a nothingness. Even inside it I somehow kept staying
outside. As though it was not deep enough to hold me and
left parts of me still in the hallway, in the greatest rejection I
had ever experienced: I didn't fit.
At the same time, in looking at the low sky of the whitewashed
ceiling, I felt I was suffocating with restriction and confinement.
I needed my own home back. I forced myself to remember
that I owned that room too, it was in my apartment: for I
had walked to this room without leaving the apartment, without
going up or down stairs. Unless there were some way of
falling into a chasm horizontally, as if the building had twisted
slightly and I had been tossed from door to door until I
reached this highest one.
Stuck inside here by a web of spaces, I was forgetting the
order that I had made up for getting things organized, and I
didn't know for sure where to start. The room had no point
that you could call its starting-place and none that you could
call its end. It was of a sameness that made it undelimited.
I passed my gaze over the wardrobe, raised it to a crack in
the ceiling, trying to get a better hold on that enormous, empty
space. More boldly, but with no intimacy, I ran my fingers
over the prickly mattress.
Then an idea came to me that gave me heart: the wardrobe,
after it was well nourished with water, its fibers completely
swollen out, I would wax it to give it some shine, and I'd even
put a coat of wax on the inside, since it must be even more
parched in there.
I opened the narrow wardrobe door a crack, and the dark
inside came out like a breath of air. I tried to open it a little
more, but the door was blocked because it hit against the foot
of the bed. All of my head that would fit in I stuck through
the crack that the door made. And, as though the darkness
inside were spying on me, we remained for an instant spying
on each other without seeing each other. I didn't see anything,
I only noticed the hot, dry smell, like the smell of a live
chicken. But I pushed the bed a little closer to the window
and got the door open a few centimeters more.
Then, before I could even understand it, my heart turned
white like hair turns white.
 
 
 
 
 
Then, before I could even understand it, my heart turned
white like hair turns white.
Up against the face that I had thrust through the opening,
right next to my eyes, in the semidarkness, the heavy
cockroach moved. My scream was so muffled that it was only
by the contrast with the silence that I realized I hadn't
screamed. The scream had stayed pounding inside my chest.
Nothing, it was nothing—I immediately tried to calm myself in
the face of my fear. It was just that I hadn't expected, in a
house that had been meticulously disinfected against my dread
of cockroaches, I hadn't expected this room to have been left
out. No, it wasn't nothing. It was a cockroach slowly moving
toward the crack.
By its enormity and slowness, it must have been a very old
cockroach. In my primeval horror of cockroaches, I had
learned to guess their ages and dangers, even at a distance;
even though I had never really come face to face with a
cockroach, I knew their life processes.
It was just that the sudden discovery of life within the
nakedness of this room had frightened me as though I had
discovered that the dead room was in fact fecund.
Everything else here had dried up—but one cockroach had
remained. A cockroach so old it was immemorial. What had
always disgusted me about cockroaches was that they were
obsolete and at the same time still living. Knowing that they
had been on Earth in the same form as they have today even
before the first dinosaurs had appeared, knowing that the first
man to come forth had found them crawling across the
ground in hoards, knowing that they had seen the formation of
the great deposits of coal and oil in the world, were there
during the great glacial advances and retreats—peaceful
resistance. I knew that cockroaches could go more than a
month without food or water. And they could even survive on
wood for food. And even after you step on them they come
apart slowly and keep on walking all the while. Even when
they freeze, after they thaw out they keep on going. For three
hundred and fifty million years, they have reproduced with no
change. When the world was practically naked, they walked
slowly across it.
Just like here, in this naked, dessicated room, a virulent speck:
on a clean test tube, a material speck.
I looked around the room, suspiciously. There was, then, this
cockroach. Or cockroaches. Where? maybe behind the suitcases.
One? two? how many? Behind the immovable silence of the
suitcases, maybe a whole black pile of cockroaches. One
motionless atop the one beneath. Layers of cockroaches—which
suddenly reminded me of what I once discovered as a child
when I lifted up the mattress I was sleeping on: the blackness
of hundreds upon hundreds of bedbugs huddled one on top of
another.
The recollection of my childhood poverty, with bedbugs, leaky
roofs, cockroaches, and rats was like a prehistoric past of me,
I had lived with the first creatures on earth.
One cockroach? more? but how many? I asked myself in a
fury. I let my gaze move slowly over the naked room. No
sound, no sign: but how many? No sound and still I clearly
sensed an emphatic vibration that was the vibration of silence
rubbing against silence. Hostility had taken me over. More than
just not liking cockroaches: I really hate them. Besides, they
are miniature versions of a huge animal. The hostility increased.
It wasn't I who rejected the room, as I had felt for an instant
at the door. The room, with its secret cockroach, had repelled
me. I had been repelled by the sight of a nakedness as strong
as a mirage's nakedness; for it had not been the mirage of an
oasis that I had seen but the mirage of a desert. Afterward, I
had been immobilized by the harsh message on the wall: the
figures with the hands spread out had been one of the series
of sentinels at the door to the sarcophagus. I now understood
that the cockroach and Janair were the room's true
inhabitants.
No, I wouldn't do any cleaning—not if there were going to be
cockroaches. The new maid could dedicate her first workday to
this dusty, empty casket.
Even in the fierce heat of the sun, a wave of shivers ran
through me: I hurried to leave that burning chamber.
It was my first physical act of fear, finally expressed, that
revealed to me with surprise that I was afraid. And that
plunged me into a greater fear—in trying to leave, between the
wardrobe and the foot of the bed, I tripped and fell. The very
possibility of a fall in this room of silence made my body recoil
in profound dread—stumbling had turned my attempted flight
into an act ill-fated in itself—could this be the way that "they,"
the inhabitants of the sarcophagus, had of keeping me from
getting away? They were keeping me from getting out by using
this one simple means: they left me completely free since they
knew that I could no longer get out without stumbling and
falling.
I wasn't really penned in, I was just cornered. As cornered as
if they had fastened me here with the single, simple act of
pointing a finger at me, at me and then at the spot.
I had experienced sensitivity to place before. When I was a
child, I had suddenly had the sense that I was lying on a bed
that was in a city that was on the Land that was in the
World. Just as when I was a child, I now had the clear sense
that I was completely alone in a house and that the house was
high and free-floating in the air, and that this house had
invisible cockroaches in it.
Before when I put myself in a place, I grew. This time I put
myself in a place by shrinking—shrinking so much that the only
space I took up in the room was between the foot of the bed
and the wardrobe door.
But this time the sensitivity to place was, fortunately, not
happening to me at night, as it had when I was a child, since
it now had to be somewhere after ten in the morning.
And, unexpectedly, the coming hour of eleven took on a horror
for me—just as with place, so too time became palpable, I
wanted to flee like from inside of a clock, and I rushed
awkwardly.
But to get out of the corner I had put myself in by opening
the wardrobe door, I would have to close that door, which was
pinning me against the bed leg: here I was, with no way clear,
cornered by the sun, which was now burning the hair on the
nape of my neck in an oven-blast called ten o'clock in the
morning.
My quick hand moved to close the wardrobe door and open
me a path—but it immediately drew back again.
For, inside the wardrobe, the cockroach moved.
I stayed quiet. My breathing was light, superficial. I now had
the sense that my situation was hopeless. And I knew that,
absurd though it might be, my only chance of getting out lay
in facing up to the absurd fact that there was something
irresolvable here. I knew that I had to recognize the danger I
was in, even though I knew that it was crazy to believe in an
entirely nonexistent danger. But I had to believe in myself—like
everyone else, I had been in danger all my life—to get free this
time, I had the mind-boggling responsibility of having to face
that fact.
Closed in as I was between the wardrobe door and the foot of
the bed, I hadn't yet given a second try at moving my feet to
get out, but I had moved back, as though despite its extreme
slowness the cockroach could swoop out in an instant—I had
seen roaches that suddenly took off in flight: winged fauna.
I stayed there, still, plans racing madly through my mind. I
was alert, I was completely alert. A great sense of hope arose
inside me, and a surprised resignation: in this alert hope I
recognized all my prior hope, I recognized too the attentiveness
that I had experienced before, the attentiveness that never
leaves me and that, in the final analysis, may be the thing that
is most a part of my life—that perhaps is my very life itself.
And then, the cockroach: what is the only sense a cockroach
has? attentiveness to living, inseparable from its body. For me,
anything that I had added to what was inseparable from me
would probably never hold back that attentiveness which, more
than an attentiveness to life, was my very life process itself.
It was then that the cockroach started to come out from
inside.
 
 
 
 
It was then that the cockroach started to come out from
inside.
First the annunciatory flutter of the antennae.
Then, behind those dry threads, the reluctant body started to
appear. Until almost the whole thing was right at the opening
of the wardrobe door.
It was grayish, it was hesitant, as though it carried enormous
weight. It was now almost completely visible.
I quickly lowered my eyes. By hiding my eyes I hid from the
cockroach the cunning stratagem that had just taken hold of
me—my heart beat almost as with joy. For I had suddenly felt
that I had some reserves, that I had never used them
before—and now a latent power at last beat inside me and a
greatness took me over: a greatness of courage, as if fear itself
was what had finally provided me with courage. Just moments
before, I had thought, superficially, that my only feelings were
ones of indignation and disgust, but now I recognized—although
I had never known it before—that what was happening was
that I had finally taken on a huge fear, much greater than
myself.
That huge fear completely pervaded me. Turned in upon
myself, like a blind man listening to his own listening, I for the
first time felt myself taken over by an instinct. And I shivered
with great delight, as though I were finally in touch with the
grandeur of an instinct that was horrible, totally and completely
sweet—as though I were finally experiencing, and within myself,
a grandeur greater than myself. I was for the first time
becoming drunk with a hatred as clean as water from a
spring, I was becoming drunk with the desire, justified or not,
to kill.
An entire life of attentiveness —for fifteen centuries I hadn't
fought, for fifteen centuries I hadn't killed, for fifteen centuries I
hadn't died—an entire life of aloof attentiveness now came
together inside me and rang, like a mute bell whose vibrations
I didn't need to hear, for I recognized them. As though at last
I was for the first time in balance with Nature.
A completely controlled rapaciousness had possessed me, and
because it was controlled it was pure power. Up to then, I had
never been mistress of my powers, powers that I neither
understood nor wanted to understand, but the life in me had
stored them up so that one day there would blossom forth this
unknown, happy, unconscious matter that was, finally, me! me,
whatever that might be.
Without any reticence at all, moved by my delivery over to
what is wicked, without any reticence, moved, happy, I was for
the first time being the unknown figure that I was . . . but,
not knowing myself would no longer be an obstacle for me,
the truth had just gone beyond the limits of myself: I raised
my hand as though to take an oath, and in one move I
slammed the door on the cockroach's half-protruding body . . .
Simultaneously, I had shut my eyes. And I stayed that way, all
ashake. What had I done?
Could I have known right then that I wasn't referring to what
I had done to the cockroach but instead to . . . what I had
done to myself?
In those instants when my eyes were closed I became aware
of myself like one becomes aware of a taste: I had through
and through the taste of steel and malice, I was all acid, like a
piece of metal sitting on your tongue, like a crushed green
plant, my taste came full into my mouth. What had I done to
myself? My heart pounding, my temples pulsing, I had done
this to myself: I had killed. I had killed! But why this jubilation
and, even more than it itself, why the vital acceptance of the
jubilation? For how long, then, had I been primed to kill?
No, that wasn't the issue. The question was: what had I killed?
That calm woman that I had always been, had she gone crazy
with pleasure? my eyes still closed, I was trembling with
jubilation. Killing . . was so much greater than I, was of a
piece with this measureless room. Killing had at last opened up
the dry sands of this room to moisture, at last, as though I
had dug and dug, with hard, avid fingers, until I found inside
myself a potable stream of life that was the stream of a death.
I slowly opened my eyes, now in sweetness, in gratitude,
timidity, in a shyness of glory.
From the finally moist world from which I was emerging, I
opened my eyes and encountered again the great, harsh, open
light, I saw the wardrobe door, now closed.
And I saw the cockroach's front half sticking out of the door.
Sticking forward, erect in the air, a caryatid.
But a living caryatid.
At first I didn't understand, I just looked in surprise. Slowly I
realized what had happened: I hadn't pushed the door hard
enough. I had, to be sure, trapped the cockroach in the door
so it couldn't come out any farther. But I had left it alive.
Alive and looking at me. I turned my eyes aside in a quick,
violent reaction.
I still needed, then, the final stroke. One more thrust? I didn't
look at the roach, but I kept telling myself that I needed one
more thrust—I kept slowly telling myself that, as though every
repetition worked to send a command order to my heartbeats,
the beats that were spaced too much like a pain whose
sensation I couldn't feel.
Until—succeeding at last in hearing myself, at last succeeding in
giving myself orders—I lifted my arm up high, as if my entire
body weight would come down on the wardrobe door along
with the blow from my arm.
But it was then that I saw the cockroach's face.
It was aimed straight ahead, at the same level as my head
and eyes. For an instant I paused with my hand poised in the
air. Then, gradually, I lowered it.
An instant before I might not have been able to see the
expression on the cockroach's face.
But it was too late by a split second: I had seen it. My hand,
which came down when I stopped the blow, slowly rose again
to my stomach: though I had not moved from the spot, my
stomach had recoiled inside my body. My mouth had become
too dry, I passed my tongue, which was also dry, over my
rough lips.
It was a shapeless face. The antennae stuck out in whiskers at
the sides of the mouth. The brown mouth was clearly
demarcated. The thin, long whiskers moved about slow and
dry. Its faceted black eyes looked around. It was a cockroach
as old as a fossilized fish. It was a cockroach as old as
salamanders, and chimeras, and griffins, and leviathans. It was
as ancient as a legend. I looked at its mouth: there was the
real mouth.
I had never seen a cockroach's mouth. I, in fact. . . I had
never really seen a cockroach. I had only felt repugnance at
their ancient, ever-present existence . . . but I had never come
face to face with one, even in my mind.
And so I discovered that despite their compactness, they are
made up of shell after shell, gray and thin, like the layers of
an onion, as though you could lift one layer up with your
fingernail and there would always be another one underneath,
and another. Maybe those layers were the wings, but then it
would be made up of layer after thin layer of wings
compressed to form that compact body.
It was an auburn color. And all covered with cilia. Maybe the
cilia were the multiple legs. The antennae were quiet now, dry,
dusty filaments.
Cockroaches don't have noses. I looked at it, with that mouth
of its, and its eyes: it looked like a dying mulatto woman. But
its eyes were black and radiant. The eyes of a girl about to be
married. Each eye itself looked like a cockroach. Each fringed,
dark, live, dusted eye. And the other one just the same. Two
cockroaches mounted on the cockroach, and each eye
reproduced the entire animal.
 
 
 
 
Each eye reproduced the entire animal.
"Pardon my putting this all on you, hand that I have in mine,
but I don't want to keep it for myself! take the cockroach, I
want nothing to do with what I saw."
There I was, mouth agape, offended, drawn back— face-to-face
with the dusty being that was looking back at me. Take away
what I saw: for what I saw, with a compulsiveness so painful
and so frightening and so innocent, what I saw was life looking
back at me.
How else could I refer to that horrible, brute raw matter and
dry plasma that was simply there while I shrank back within
myself in dry nausea, I sinking centuries and centuries deep in
mud—it was mud, and not even dried mud but mud still wet,
still alive, it was an ooze in which the roots of my identity
were twisting about with intolerable slowness.
Take, take all that for yourself, I don't want to be a living
person! I disgust myself, I marvel at myself, thick ooze coming
slowly forth.
That's how it was, that's how it was, then. I had looked upon
the live cockroach and had discovered in it my deepest life
identity. In a difficult demolition, hard, narrow passages were
opening inside me.
I looked at it, at the cockroach; I hated it so much that I was
changing sides, forming solidarity with it, since I couldn't bear
being alone with my own aggressiveness.
And all at once I groaned out loud, this time I heard my
groan. My truest coherence was in fact rising up to the surface
of me, like a pus—and I sensed, with fright and dread, that
that "I-being" came from a source much prior to any human
source, and, horribly, much greater than any human one as
well.
There was opening out in me, with the slowness of stone
gates, there was opening out in me the wide life of silence, the
very life that was to be found in the stationary sun, the very
one that was to be found in the motionless cockroach. And it
could be the very same inside me! if I had the courage to
abandon ... to abandon my feelings? If I had the courage to
abandon hope.
Hope in what? For the first time I had the great fear of
feeling that I had based an entire hope on becoming something
I was not. The hope—what other word is there for it?—that for
the first time now I was going to abandon, through courage
and through mortal curiosity. In my life up to now had that
hope been grounded in a truth? With childish astonishment, I
now . . . doubted.
To know what I really had to hope for, would I have to pass
through my, truth? To what extent had I up to now invented
one destiny while in my depths living on another?
I closed my eyes, waiting for this strange feeling to pass,
waiting for my panting to become something more than the
panting in that groan that I had heard as though it were
coming from the depths of a dry, deep cistern, just as the
cockroach is the creature of a dry cistern. I kept feeling the
groan, incalculably far within me, but it was no longer reaching
my throat.
This is madness, I thought, with my eyes closed. But the sense
of that birth from within the dust was so undeniable . . . that
I could only follow what I knew very well was not madness
but was, my God, a worse truth, the horrible truth. But why
horrible? Because it wordlessly contradicted everything I had
been accustomed, also wordlessly, to think.
I waited for the strange feeling to pass, for health to return.
But I recognized, with a long-forgotten force of memory, that I
had felt this feeling before: it was the same feeling I had had
when I saw my own blood outside myself, and I was shocked
by it. For the blood that I saw outside myself, that blood I
wondered at with such attraction: it was my own.
I didn't want to open my eyes again, I didn't want to keep on
seeing. The rules and laws, it was important not to forget
them, you have to remember that without the rules and laws
there would also be no order, it was important for me not to
forget them and, in order to defend myself, to defend them.
But the fact was that I could no longer hold myself down.
The first tie had already involuntarily broken, and I was
loosening myself from law, even though I suspected that I
would be going into the inferno of living matter—what sort of
inferno awaited me? but I had to go. I had to fall into my
soul's condemnation, curiosity was consuming me.
Then, all at once, I opened my eyes and saw full-on the
room's limitless vastness, that room that resounded in
silence—Hellish laboratory.
The room, the unexpected room. My entrance into it had
finally become complete.
This room had only one way in, and it was a narrow one:
through the cockroach. The cockroach that filled the room with
a resonance that was in the last analysis open, the resonances
of its rattlesnake bells in the desert. By a perilous road I had
reached the deep breach in the wall that was that room . . .
and the break formed a wide natural hall like in a cave.
Bare, as though prepared for only one person's entrance. And
whoever came in would be transformed into a "she" or into a
"he." I was the person the room called "she." I had come in
an "I," but the room then gave me the dimensions of "she."
As though I were also the other side of a cube, the side that
you don't see because you are seeing the front side.
And, in my great expansion, I was on the desert. How can I
make you understand? I was on the desert as I had never
been before. It was a desert that called me like a monotonous,
remote canticle calls. I was being seduced. And I went toward
that enticing madness. But my fear was not the fear of
someone who was going toward madness and thus toward a
truth—my fear was the fear of having a truth that I would
come to despise, a defamatory truth that would make me get
down and exist at the level of the cockroach. My first contact
with truths always defamed me.
"Hold my hand tight, because I feel that I'm going. I am again
going to the most primary divine life, I am going to an inferno
of brute life. Don't let me see because I am close to seeing the
core of life—and through the cockroach, which I am now
beginning to see again, through that sample of calm, live fear, I
am afraid that in that core I won't know anymore what hope
is."
The cockroach is pure seduction. Cilia, blinking cilia that
beckon.
I too, gradually reducing myself to what was irreducible in me,
I too had thousands of cilia blinking, and with my cilia I
advance, I protozoic, pure protein. Hold my hand tight, I have
reached the irreducible with the fatefulness of a deathknell—I
sense that all this is ancient and immense, I sense in the
hieroglyph of the slow cockroach the writing of the Far East.
And in this desert of great seductions, the creatures: I and the
live cockroach. Life, my love, is one great seduction where
everything that exists is seduced. That room that was desert
and therefore primitively alive. I had reached nothingness, and
the nothingness was live and moist.
 
 
 
 
I had reached nothingness, and the nothingness was live and
moist.
It was then—it was then that the pulp started slowly to come
out of the cockroach I had smashed, like out of a tube.
The cockroach's pulp, which was its insides, raw matter that
was whitish and thick and slow, was piling up on it as though
it were toothpaste coming out of the tube.
Before my nauseated, attracted eyes, the cockroach's form, as it
grew on the outside, kept slowly changing. The white matter
was slowly spreading across its back, like a load set for it to
carry. Pinched in place, it was increasingly carrying on its dusty
back a load that was in fact its own body.
"Scream," I silently commanded myself. "Scream," I told myself
again with a sigh of deep quietude.
The white mass had stopped piling up on top of the shell. I
looked up to the ceiling, resting for a while eyes that I could
feel had grown great and deep.
But if I had screamed, even if only once, I might never have
been able to stop. If I had screamed, nobody could have done
anything to help me; as it is, if I never reveal my lacking, no
one will become frightened of me, and they'll help me without
knowing it; but only so long as I don't frighten anyone by
going beyond the rules. But if they know, they become
frightened, we who keep our screams inviolable secrets. If I
give the call of alarm of someone living, they will drag me
along silently and harshly, for that is what they do to anyone
who crosses the lines of the permissible world, the exceptional
being is dragged along, the being who screams.
I looked up to the ceiling with heavy eyes. Everything was
summed up fiercely in my never uttering an initial scream—a
first scream sets off all the others, the first scream of birth sets
off a life, if I were to scream it would awaken thousands of
screaming beings who would unleash a chorus of screams and
horror all along the rooftops. If I screamed, it would unleash
existence—the existence of what? the existence of the world. For
myself, I reverently feared the existence of the world.
"The fact, oh hand that gives me strength, the fact is that, in
an experience that I would like to forget, an experience for
which I ask forgiveness of myself, I was leaving my world and
going into the world."
The fact is that I was no longer seeing myself, I was just
seeing. An entire civilization that had been set up having as its
guarantee that one should immediately mix what one sees with
what one feels, an entire civilization that has self-salvation as its
foundation stone—I was now in its debris. The only person
who can get out of that civilization is one whose special
function is getting out: a scientist is given the chance, a priest
has permission. But not a woman who hasn't the guarantee
that such titles bring. And I fled, regretfully, I fled.
If you knew the loneliness of those first steps I took. It wasn't
like a person's loneliness. It was as though I had died and was
taking my first steps alone into another life. And it was as
though they called that loneliness glory, and I too knew that it
was a kind of glory, and I shook all over with that primary,
divine glory that I not only did not understand but also
profoundly wanted to reject.
"Because, look, I knew that I was entering the crude, raw
glory of nature. Seduced, I nonetheless struggled as much as I
could against the shifting sands that were sucking me down:
and every move that I made toward 'no, no,' every new move
pushed me inexorably; not having the strength to struggle was
my only pardon."
I looked around the room in which I had been imprisoned
and looked for a way out, desperately looked to escape, and
within myself I had already retreated so far that my soul had
flattened itself against the wall . . . without even being able to
stop myself, without even wanting to stop anymore, fascinated
by the control of the magnet that was pulling me, I retreated
within myself, up against the wall, onto which I grafted myself
in the design of the woman. I had retreated all the way to the
marrow of my bones, my last redoubt. Where, on the wall, I
was so naked that I cast no shadow.
And the dimensions, the dimensions remained the same, I
could feel that they were, I knew that I had never been
anything other than that woman on the wall, I was her. And I
was completely perpetuated, a long, fecund road.
My tension suddenly broke, like a noise cut off.
And the first real silence began to blow. That tranquil, vast,
strange something that I had seen in my dim, smiling,
photographs—that something was outside of me for the first
time and entirely within my reach, incomprehensible but within
my reach.
What assuaged me, like slaking a thirst, assuaged me as
though all my life I had been waiting for a water as vital for
the bristling body as cocaine is for someone crying out for it.
At last, the body, imbued with silence, found peace. Relief came
from my fitting into the silent design of that cavern.
Up to that moment I had not fully seen my struggle, so
immersed had I been in it. But now, because of the silence
into which I had finally fallen, I knew that I had been
struggling, that I had succumbed, and that I had given in.
And that, as of right now, I was really in the room.
As much a part of it as a drawing made three million years
ago in a cave. And that is how I fit within myself, and how
within my very self I was etched on that wall.
The narrow passage had been the daunting cockroach, and I
had slipped with disgust through that body of scales and ooze.
And I had ended up, all impure myself, embarking, through it,
upon my past, which was my continuous present and my
continuous future—and which, today and ever, is on the wall,
and my fifteen million daughters, from that time down to
myself, were also there. My life had been as continuous as
death. Life is so continuous that we divide it into stages and
call one of them death. I had always been in life, it mattered
little that it was not I properly speaking, not that thing that I
customarily call "I." I had always been in life.
I, neutral cockroach body, I with a life that at last is not
eluding me because I finally see it outside myself—I am the
cockroach, I am my leg, I am my hair, I am the section of
brightest light on the wall plaster—I am every Hellish piece of
myself—life is so pervasive in me that if they divide me in
pieces like a lizard, the pieces will keep on shaking and
writhing. I am the silence etched on a wall, and the most
ancient butterfly flutters in and looks at me: just the same as
always. From birth to death is what I call human in myself,
and I shall never actually die.
But this is not eternity, it is condemnation.
How opulent this silence is. It is the accumulation of centuries.
It is the silence of a cockroach looking. The world looks at
itself in me. Everything looks at everything, everything
experiences the other; in this desert things know things. Things
know things as much as this . . . this something that I shall
call pardon, if I wish to save myself within the human plan. It
is pardon in itself. Pardon is one of the attributes of living
matter.
 
 
 
 
Pardon is one of the attributes of living matter.
"See here, my precious, see how I am organizing for fear, see
how I still cannot touch those primary laboratory elements
without immediately trying to put a hope together. So as of yet
my inner metamorphosis makes no sense. In such a
metamorphosis, I lose everything I have had, and what I have
had has been myself—all that I have is what I am. And what
am I now? I am: a standing in the presence of fear. I am:
what I have seen. I don't understand and I am afraid to
understand, the matter of the world frightens me, with its
planets and its cockroaches."
I, who before lived on words of charity, or pride— or
something. But what an abyss between the word and what it
sought to do, what an abyss between the word love and the
love that does not even have a human
sense—because—because love is living matter. Is love living
matter?
What was it that happened to me yesterday? and now? I'm
confused, I have crossed desert after desert, but have I
remained trapped under some detail? like under a rock.
No, wait, wait: I must remember with relief that since yesterday
I have left that room, I have got out, I'm free! and I still have
a chance to get it all back. If I want to.
But do I want to?
What I have seen is unorganizable. But if I really want to, right
now, I can still translate it into terms that would be more like
ours, into human terms, and I can still put aside those hours
of yesterday. If I still want to, I can ask myself in another
way, a way that is within our language, what happened to me.
And, if I question myself that way, I can still have an answer
that will get it all back. That recovery would be to acknowledge
that G. H. was a woman who lived well, well, well, who lived
in the top layer of the world's sands, and the sands had never
given way beneath her feet; the harmony was such that when
the sands moved her feet moved in concert with them, so
everything stayed firm and compacted. G. H. lived on the top
floor of a superstructure, and, even though it was built in the
air, it was a solid building, she herself too in the air, like bees
weave their life in the air. And the same thing had been
happening for centuries, with the necessary or incidental
variations, and it worked. It worked—at least nothing spoke,
and no one spoke, no one said "no": so, it worked.
But precisely the slow accumulation of centuries automatically
piling up was what was making that building in the air very
heavy, without anyone noticing, that building was becoming
saturated with itself: it was becoming more and more
compacted instead of more and more fragile. The accumulation
of living in a superstructure was becoming ever closer to too
heavy to stay in the air.
Like a building with all its occupants sleeping securely at night
not knowing that its foundations are sagging and, at one
instant unannounced by their tranquility, the beams will give
way because the building's cohesion is slowly being pulled apart,
a millimeter per century. And then, when it's least expected—in
an instant as repetitiously habitual as the instant of raising a
drinking glass to your smiling lips while at a dance—then,
yesterday, a day as sun-filled as these days at the height of
summer usually are, with men working and kitchens giving off
smoke and the jackhammer breaking the stones and the
children laughing and a priest trying to prevent, but to prevent
what?— yesterday, without warning, there was the crash of
solidness suddenly become crumbly in demolition.
In the collapse, tons fell upon tons. When I, G. H. even on
my luggage, I, one of the people, opened my eyes, I was—not
on top of the rubble, for even the rubble had been swallowed
up by the sands—I was on a quiet plain, kilometers and
kilometers below what had been a great city. Things had gone
back to being what they had been.
The world had reclaimed its own reality, and, just like after a
catastrophe, my culture had ended: I was merely a historical
fact. Everything in me had been reclaimed by the beginning of
time and by my own beginning. I had passed on to a first,
primary plane, I was in the silence of the winds and in the
age of tin and copper—at the first age of life.
Listen, in the presence of the living cockroach, the worst
discovery was that the world is not human, and that we are
not human.
No, don't be afraid! What had saved me up to that moment
in the sentimentalized life that I had lived on was doubtless
that the inhuman is our better part, is the thing, the thing part
of people. It was only because of that that I, like a false
person, had not by then sunk under my sentimentalistic and
utilitarian constitution: my human sentiments were utilitarian,
but I had not foundered because the thing part, God-matter,
was too strong and was waiting to reclaim me. The great
neutral punishment of life in general is that it can suddenly
undermine a specific life; if it is not given strength of its own,
then it bursts like a dike bursts—and becomes pure, with no
admixture: purely neutral. That was the great danger: when
that neutral thing part does not filter through a personal life,
all that life can become pure neutrality.
But exactly why had the first silence come suddenly to be
remade in me? As if one quiet woman had simply been called
and had quietly stood up, left her embroidery on her chair,
and, without a word—leaving her life, abandoning embroidery,
love, and priorly constituted soul—without a word that woman
had calmly got down on all fours and begun to go about that
way, and to crawl with calm, glaring eyes: that prior life had
reclaimed her and she had gone.
But why me? But why not me. If it hadn't been me, I
wouldn't have known, and since it was me, I found out—
that's all there is to it, nothing more. What was it that had
called me: madness or reality?
Life was taking its vengeance on me, and that vengeance
consisted merely in coming back, nothing more. Every case of
madness involves something coming back. People who are
possessed are not possessed by something that just comes but
instead by something that comes back. Sometimes life comes
back. If in me everything crumbled before that power, it is not
because that power was in itself necessarily an overwhelming
one: it in fact had only to come, since it had already become
too full-flowing a force to be controlled or contained—when it
appeared it overran everything. And then, like after a flood,
there floated a wardrobe, a person, a loose window, three
suitcases. And that seemed like Hell to me, that destruction of
layers and layers of human archaeology.
Hell, because the world held no more human sense for me,
and man held no more human sense for me. And in the
absence of that humanization and in the absence of that
sentimentalization of the world—I become terrified.
Without a scream, I looked at the cockroach.
Looked at up close, the cockroach is an object of great
opulence. A bride with black jewelry. It is completely unique, it
seems one of a kind. By pinching the middle of its body in the
wardrobe door, I had isolated the only specimen. All that
showed was half its body. The rest that was not in view could
have been huge and been in thousands of homes, behind
things and wardrobes. I, however, did not want the part that
had come to be mine. Behind the surfaces of buildings —those
dusky jewels scraping along the ground?
I felt impure, as the Bible speaks of the impure. Why did the
Bible spend so much time on the impure, even to making a
list of impure and forbidden animals? Why, if, like all the rest,
they too had been created? And why was the impure
forbidden? I had committed the forbidden act of touching
something impure.
 
 
 
 
I had committed the forbidden act of touching something
impure.
And so impure was I, in my sudden, indirect moment of
self-knowledge, that I opened my mouth to call for help. They
proclaim; the Bible does, they proclaim, but if I understand
what they proclaim, it will be they who call me crazy. People
like me had proclaimed, but understanding them would be my
destruction.
"But you shall not eat of the impure: which are the eagle, the
griffin, and the hawk." Nor the owl, nor the swan, nor the bat,
nor the stork, nor the entire tribe of crows.
I knew that the Bible's impure animals were forbidden because
the impure is the root—for there are things created that have
never made themselves beautiful and have stayed just as they
were when created, and only they still continue to be the
entirely complete root. And because they are the entirely
complete root, they are not to be eaten, the fruit of good and
of evil—eating of living matter would expel me from a paradise
of adornments and lead me to walk forever through the desert
with a shepherd's staff. Many have been those who have
walked in the desert with a staff.
Or even worse—it would lead me to see that the desert too is
alive and has moisture, and to see that everything is alive and
is made of the same thing.
To build a possible soul—a soul whose head will not devour its
own tail—the law commands that one use only what is patently
alive. And the law commands that whoever partakes of the
impure must do so without knowing. For he who partakes of
the impure knowing that it is impure . . . must also come to
know that the impure is not impure. Is that it?
"And everything that crawls on the ground and has wings shall
be impure and shall not be eaten."
I opened my mouth in fright: to ask for help. Why? because I
did not want to become impure like the cockroach? what ideal
held me to the sensing of an idea? why should I not make
myself impure, exactly as I was revealing my whole self? What
was I afraid of? being impure with what?
Being impure with joy.
For now I understand that what I had begun to feel was joy,
which I still had not yet recognized or understood. In my silent
call for help, what I was struggling against was a vague first
joy that I did not want to sense in myself because, albeit
vague, it was already horrible: it was a joy without redemption,
I don't know how to make it clear for you, but it was a joy
without hope.
"Oh, don't pull your hand away from me, I've promised myself
that maybe by the end of this impossible narrative I shall
understand, oh maybe it will be on Hell's road that I shall be
able to find what we need—but don't pull your hand away,
even though I now know that the finding has to come on the
road of what we are, if I can succeed in not sinking completely
into what we are."
See, my love, I am losing the courage to find whatever it is I
shall have to find, I am losing the courage to give myself over
to the road itself, and I am now promising us that in that Hell
I shall find hope.
"Perhaps it is not the ancient hope. Perhaps it cannot even be
called hope."
I was struggling because I did not want an unknown joy. It
would be as forbidden by my future salvation as the forbidden
beast that was called impure—and I was opening and closing
my mouth in torture to call for help, but then it still hadn't
occurred to me to invent this hand that I have now invented
to hold mine. In my fear yesterday I was alone, and I wanted
to ask for help against my first dehumanization.
Dehumanization is as painful as losing everything, as losing
everything, my love. I was opening and closing my mouth to
call for help but I neither could nor knew how to enunciate.
The problem was that I no longer had anything to say. My
agony was like the agony of trying to talk before dying. I knew
that I was leaving something forever, something was going to
die, and I wanted to pronounce the word that would at least
capture that thing that was dying.
Finally I at least succeeded in articulating a thought: "I am
asking for help."
Then it occurred to me that I had nothing to ask for help
against. I had nothing to ask.
Suddenly, this was it. I was understanding that "ask" was a
leftover from an entreatable world, which was becoming more
and more remote. And if I continued trying to ask, it was to
cling to the remainders of my old culture, to cling so tight that
I wouldn't be pulled along by what was now reclaiming me.
And to which—in a pleasure without hope—I was now giving
in, oh I now wanted to give in—to have experienced it was
now the beginning of a Hell of wanting, wanting, wanting . . .
Was my will to want stronger than my will to salvation?
Every time I tried, I had nothing to ask for. And I saw, in
fascination and horror, the pieces of my rotten mummy clothes
fall dry to the floor; I witnessed my own metamorphosis from
chrysalis to moist larva, my wings slowly drying and opening
out. And a completely new belly made for the ground, a new
belly was being reborn.
Without turning my eyes away from the cockroach, I lowered
myself until I felt my body meet the bed and, without turning
my eyes away from the cockroach, I sat down.
Now it was with eyes raised that I looked at it. Now, bent
over on top of its own middle, it looked me end to end. I had
trapped in front of myself the impure of the world— and I had
disenchanted the living thing. I had lost my ideas.
Then, again, another full millimeter of white matter spurted out.
 
 
 
 
Then, again, another full millimeter of white matter spurted out.
Holy Mary, mother of God, I offer you my life in exchange for
that moment yesterday's being untrue. The cockroach covered
with the white matter was looking at me. I don't know if it
saw me, I don't know what a cockroach sees. But the two of
us were looking at each other, and I also don't know what a
woman sees. But if its eyes didn't see me, its existence existed
me: in the primary world that I had entered, beings exist other
beings as a way of seeing one another. And in that world that
I was coming to know, there are various modes that mean to
see: one being looking at the other without seeing it, one
possessing the other, one eating the other, one simply being in
a corner and the other being there too: all that also means to
see. The cockroach didn't see me directly, it was with me. The
cockroach saw me not with its eyes but with its body.
And I ... I saw. There was no way not to see it. There was
no way to deny it: my convictions and my wings were drying
out quickly: that was all they were there for. There was no
way to deny it any longer. I don't know what it was that I
could no longer deny, but I could no longer.
Nor could I any longer save myself, like before, with a whole
culture that would help me to deny what I was seeing.
I was seeing all of it, the cockroach.
A cockroach is an ugly, shiny being. The cockroach is inside
out. No, no, I don't mean that it has an inside and an
outside; I mean that is what it is. What it had on the outside
is what I hide inside myself: I have made my outside into a
hidden inside. It was looking at me. And it wasn't a face. It
was a mask. A deep sea diver's mask. That precious,
rusty-colored gem. The two eyes were alive like two ovaries. It
looked at me with the blind fertility of its look. It was making
my dead fertility fertile. Could its eyes be salty? If I touched
them—since I was slowly becoming more and more impure
anyway—if I touched them with my mouth, would I taste salt
in them?
I had tasted a man's eyes with my mouth and could tell that
he was crying by the saltiness.
But, as I thought about the salt in the cockroach's black eyes,
I suddenly recoiled again, and my dry lips curled back all the
way to my teeth: the reptiles that move across the earth! In
the stationary reverberation of light in the room, the cockroach
was a small, slow crocodile. The dry, resonating room. I and
the cockroach poised in that dryness, like on the dry crust of
an extinct volcano. That desert I had gone into, and there I
had also discovered life and its salt.
Again the white part of the cockroach squirted out, probably
less than a millimeter.
This time, I barely, barely noticed the tiny outward movement
that the matter made. I looked on, absorbed, silent.
"Never, before that time, had life happened to me during the
daytime. Never in sunlight. Only, at night had the world slowly
turned for me. Only, what would happen in the blackness of
night itself also simultaneously happened in my own innards,
and my blackness became undifferentiated from the outside
blackness, and, in the morning when I opened my eyes, the
world kept right on being a surface: the secret night life soon
receded in my mouth to being the taste of a disappearing
nightmare. But now life was happening in the daytime.
Undeniable, there to see. Unless I turned my eyes away."
And I could still turn my eyes away.
"But Hell already had hold of me, my sweet, the Hell of a
morbid curiosity. I was already disposing of my human soul,
because seeing had begun to consume me with pleasure, I was
selling my future, selling my salvation, selling us."
"I am calling for help," I suddenly shouted to myself, with the
silence of those who have their mouths slowly drifted full of
shifting sand, "I am calling for help," I thought, quiet and calm.
But never once did it occur to me that I might get up and
leave, as though that would be impossible. The cockroach and
I had been buried in a mine cave-in."
The scale suddenly had only one plate. On that side was my
deep rejection of cockroaches. But "rejection of cockroaches"
was merely a set of words, and I also knew that at the time
when I myself died I too would be untranslatable into words.
Of my own death, yes, I was indeed aware, for death was the
future and is imaginable, and I had always had time to
imagine. But the instant, the very instant—the right now—that
is unimaginable, between the right now and the I there is no
space: it is just now, inside me.
"Understand me, I had death down pat and death was no
longer demanding of me. But what I had never experienced
before was this running up against the moment called 'right
now.' Today places demands on me today. I had never before
realized that the moment of living too has no words. The
moment of living, my love, was becoming so 'now' that I was
putting my mouth into the matter of life. The moment of living
is a ceaseless, slow creaking of doors continually opening wide
open. Two gates were opening and had never stopped opening.
But they continually opened out on ... on nothingness?"
The moment of living is so Hellishly inexpressive that it is
nothingness. What I called "nothingness," however, was so
plastered to me that was it. . . me, to me? and therefore
became invisible, like I was invisible to myself, and became
nothingness. The doors kept on opening, as always.
Finally, my love, I fell. And it became a "now."
 
 
 
 
Finally, my love, I fell. And it became a now.
It was finally now. It was simply now. It was like this: the
country was at 11:00 A
.
M
. Superficially like a green yard, of
the most delicate superficiality. Green, green—green is a yard.
Between myself and that green, the water of the air. The green
water of the air. I see everything through a full glass. And
nothing is to be heard. In the rest of the house, shadows are
all swollen. Ripe superficiality. It is 11:0.0 A
.
M
. in Brazil. It is
now. That means exactly now. Now is time swollen as far as it
can be swollen. 11:00 has no depth. 11:00 is full of eleven
hours up to the brim of the green glass. Time quivers like a
stationary balloon. The air, fertile and panting. Until, with a
national anthem, the tolling of 11:30 cuts the balloon's
restraining ropes. And suddenly we'll all reach noon. Which will
be green like now.
I suddenly awoke from the unexpected green oasis where I
had for a moment completely hidden myself.
But I was on the desert. And now is not only at the heart of
an oasis; now is also on the desert, and fully. It was right
now. For the first time in my life there was a full now. This
was the greatest brutality that I had ever come up against.
For nowness brings no hope, and nowness brings no future:
the future will be precisely a now again.
I was so frightened that I became even quieter inside. For it
seemed to me that I was finally going to have to feel.
It seems that I shall have to give up everything I leave on the
other side of the gates. And I know, I knew, that if I went
through the always-open gates, I would go into the heart of
nature.
I knew that going in is no sin. But it is perilous, like dying.
Just as we die without knowing where we go, and that is a
body's greatest courage. To go in was a sin only because it
was the condemnation of my life, and I might never after be
able to return to it. Perhaps I already knew that, from those
gates onward, there would be no difference between me and
the cockroach. Either in my eyes or in the eyes of him who is
God.
That was how I was taking my first steps into nothingness. My
first hesitant steps in the direction of Life, and abandoning my
own life. My foot stepped out into the air, and I went into
paradise, or Hell: into the heart.
I ran my hand over my forehead: I noticed with relief that I
had finally started to sweat. Up to a little bit earlier there had
been only that hot dryness that dessicated us both. Now I
started to become wet.
Oh, how exhausted I am! What I would really like now would
be to cut all this off and put into this most difficult of stories,
for pure diversion and relaxation, a positive tale that I heard
one day—one of those tales about why some couple separated.
Oh, I know so many interesting tales. And too, for a break, I
could talk about tragedy. I know tragedies.
My sweat gave me relief. I looked up, to the ceiling. The
ceiling had rounded out with the play of shafts of light and
changed into something that reminded me of a vaulted ceiling.
The heat's vibration was like the resonance of an oratorio
being sung. Only my hearing apparatus sensed. A canticle with
closed mouth, sound deafly resonating like something held fast
and contained, amen, amen. A canticle of thanksgiving for the
murder of one being by another being.
The most profound of murders: one that is a mode of relating,
a way of one being existing the other being, a way of our
seeing each other and being each other and having each other,
a murder where there is neither victim nor executioner but
instead a link of mutual ferocity. My primary struggle for life.
"Lost in the Fiery Hell of a Canyon a Woman Struggles
Desperately for Life."
I waited for that silent, trapped sound to go away. But the
vastness grew within the small room, the mute oratorio opened
it out in vibrations that reached the crack in the ceiling. The
oratorio wasn't a prayer: it didn't ask for anything. Passions in
the form of an oratorio.
The cockroach suddenly vomited another white, soft spurt
through its crack.
"Oh, but whom could I go to for help, if you too," I then
thought, in the direction of a man who once was mine, "if you
too won't be able to help me now. For, like me, you tried to
transcend life, and thus you got beyond it. But I'm not going
to be able to do that anymore, I'm going to have to know,
and I'll have to go on without you, even though I have tried
to ask you for help. Pray for me, my mother, for not
transcending is a sacrifice, and transcendence used to be my
human effort at salvation, there was an immediate utility in
transcendence. Transcendence is a transgression. But staying
within what there is, that forces me not to be afraid!"
And I am going to have to stay within what there is.
Something must be said, don't you feel that something must be
understood? oh, even if later on I have to go beyond it, even
if later I transcend it, let it be fatefully born from me like the
breath of a living person.
But, after what I know, shall I consider it the exhalation of
breathing, or a miasma? no, not a miasma, I have pity on
myself! I want, if transcendence comes fatefully upon me, for it
to be like the breath born from my own mouth, the mouth
that exists, and not from a false mouth opened up in an arm
or in a head.
It was with Hellish joy that I was almost on the verge of
dying. I started to feel that my ghostly step would be
irreversible, and that I was leaving my human salvation behind
little by little. I felt that my inside, despite being soft, white
matter, nonetheless had the strength to burst my face of silver
and of beauty, good-bye worldly beauty! Beauty that is now far
from me and that I no longer want—I am unable to want
beauty anymore—maybe I really never wanted it, but it was so
nice! I recall how the game of beauty was nice, beauty was a
continual transmutation.
But I give it up with Hellish relief. What has come out of the
cockroach's belly is not something that can be transcended—oh,
I don't mean that it is the opposite of beauty, "opposite to
beauty" doesn't even make sense— what has come out of the
cockroach is: "today," blessed be the fruit of your womb—I
want nowness without decorating it with a future that will
redeem it or with a hope—up to now what hope wanted in
me was merely to sidestep nowness.
But I want much more than that: I want to find redemption in
today, in right now, in the reality that is happening, and not in
promise, I want to find joy in this instant—I want God in that
stuff that is coming out of the cockroach's belly—even if, in my
aged, human terms, that means the worst and, in human
terms, Hell.
Yes, I wanted that. But at the same time, I held the stomach's
mouth with my two hands: "I can't!" I implored another man
who also never could and never would himself. "I can't! I don't
want to know what that something that up to now I would call
nothingness is made of!" I don't want to feel directly in my so
delicate mouth the salt of the cockroach's eyes, because,
Mother mine, I had accustomed myself to the saturation of the
layers and not to the thing's simple moistness..
It was thinking about the salt in the cockroach's eyes, which,
with the sigh of one who is going to be forced to give in yet
again, I realized was still using the old human beauty: salt.
I would have to abandon the beauty of salt and the beauty of
tears as well. That too, for what I was seeing was back before
the human.
 
 
 
 
For what I was seeing was back before the human.
No, there was no salt in those eyes. I was absolutely sure that
the cockroach's eyes were completely without taste. I had
always cultivated salt, salt was the transcendence that I used to
sense a taste and to run from what I called "nothingness." I
cultivated salt, I had construed myself around salt. But what
my mouth couldn't take in . . . was insipidity. What I was
completely unprepared for . . . was the neutral.
And that neutral was the life I had been calling "nothingness."
The neutral was Hell.
The sun had moved a bit and fixed itself on my back. The
halved cockroach was also in the sun. I can't do anything for
you, roach. I don't want to do anything for you.
But it was no longer a matter of doing anything: the
cockroach's neutral look told me that that wasn't the question,
and I knew it. It was just that I couldn't tolerate just staying
seated there, just being, and so I wanted to do something.
Doing something would be transcending, transcending is a way
out.
But the moment had arrived for that not to be the question
any longer. For the cockroach knew nothing of hope or of
pity. If it wasn't pinned there and was bigger than I was, it
would kill me with a busy, neutral pleasure. Just like the violent
neutrality of its life allowed me, because I wasn't trapped and
was bigger, to kill it. That was the kind of tranquil, neutral
ferocity there was on the desert where we were.
And its eyes were insipid; not salty as I would have preferred:
salt would be sentiment, and word, and taste. I knew that the
cockroach's neutrality has the same tastelessness as its white
matter. Sitting there, I was being formed. Sitting there, being
formed, I knew that when I didn't call things salty or sweet,
sad or happy or painful, or use even subtler shadings—only
then would I not be transcending anymore and would I be
staying within the thing itself.
That thing whose name I know not was what, as I sat there
looking at the cockroach, I was now becoming able to call
without a name. Contact with that thing with no qualities and
no attributes was repugnant to me, the living thing without
name or taste or smell was disgusting. Insipidity: taste was no
longer anything more than an aftertaste: my own aftertaste.
For one instant, then, I felt a kind of shocked happiness
throughout my body, a horrible, happy indisposition in which
my legs seemed to disappear, just as always happened when
the roots of my unknown identity were touched.
Oh, at least I had now come to the point in the nature of the
cockroach where I no longer wanted to do anything for it. I
was freeing myself from my morality, and that was a
catastrophe without uproar and without tragedy.
Morality. Wouldn't it be simpleminded to think that the moral
problem in relation to others consists of acting as you ought to
act and that the moral problem in relation to yourself is to try
to feel as you ought to feel? Am I moral to the extent that I
do what I should and feel what I should?
Suddenly, the moral question seemed to me not so much
overwhelming as extremely insignificant. The moral problem, if
we are to relate to it, ought to be both less demanding and
greater. For as an ideal it is at one and the same time
insignificant and unattainable. Insignificant should it be reached;
unattainable because it cannot be reached. "Scandal still is
necessary, but woe unto him through whom the scandal
cometh"—was it the Old Testament that said that? The solution
had to be a secret one. The ethics of morality are to keep it a
secret. Freedom is a secret.
Although I know that, even in secret, freedom does not absolve
guilt. But one must be greater than guilt. My least divine part
is greater than my human guilt. God is greater than my
essential guilt. I therefore prefer God to my guilt. Not to excuse
myself and get away but because guilt lessens me.
I now wanted to do nothing for the cockroach. I was freeing
myself from my morality—even though that caused fear,
curiosity, and fascination in me, and a great deal of fear. I'm
not going to do anything for you, I too scrape along the
ground. I'm not going to do anything for you because I no
longer know the meaning of love like I thought I did before.
And too, what I thought I knew about love, that too I am
leaving behind, I almost no longer know what it is, I no longer
remember.
Maybe I'll find another name, so much crueler right from the
outset, so much more the thing itself. Or maybe I won't find
one. Is love when you don't give a name to things identity?
But I now know something horrible: I know what it's like to
need, need, need. And it's a new need, on a level that I can
only call neutral and terrible. It's a need with no pity for my
needing and no pity for the cockroach's needing. I was sitting
there, quiet, sweating, precisely like now—and I see that there
is something more serious, more fateful, and more central than
everything that I have been in the habit of calling by names. I
who called my hopes for love "love."
But now, it is within this neutral nowness of nature, and of the
cockroach, and of my body's living sleep, that I want to know
love. And I want to know if hope was a temporization with the
impossible. Or if it was a putting-off of what is possible right
now—and I haven't reached only for fear. I want a present
moment that is not something with a promise but that is, that
is being. That is the heart of what I want and I fear. That is
the heart that I never sought.
The cockroach was touching me through with its black, faceted,
shiny, neutral look.
And now I began to let it touch me. In fact, I had struggled
all my life against the deep desire to let myself be
touched—and I had struggled because I wasn't able to allow
the death of what I called my goodness; the death of human
goodness. But now I didn't want to fight against it anymore.
There had to be a goodness so other that it wouldn't resemble
goodness. I didn't want to fight anymore.
With disgust, with despair, with courage, I gave in. I had
waited too long, and now I wanted to.
Did I want to only at that very moment? No, or else I would
have left the room long ago, or simply would have scarcely
noticed the cockroach—how many times before had I come
across cockroaches and turned in another direction? I gave in,
but with a fear and a sundering.
I thought that if the telephone should ring, I would have to
answer it and could still be saved! But, like recalling a bygone
world, I remembered that I had taken the receiver off the
hook. If it hadn't been for that, it might ring, I could run out
of the room to answer it, and never, oh never again would I
come back in.
"I remember you, when I kissed your man-face, slowly, slowly
kissed it, and when the moment came to kiss your eyes—I
remember that then I tasted the salt in my mouth and that
the tear salt in your eyes was my love for you. But what had
even more wrapped me in a fright of love had been, in the
depths of the depths of the salt, your bland, innocent, childish
substance: in exchange for my kiss your more deeply insipid
life was given me, and kissing your face was bland, busy,
patient love-work, it was a woman weaving a man, just as you
had woven me, the neutral artisanry of life."
 
 
 
 
Neutral artisanry of life.
My having kissed, for a whole day, the tasteless residue in tear
salt made the room's unfamiliarity recognizable, like
already-experienced matter. If I had not recognized it till then,
it was because it had been only blandly experienced by my
deepest bland blood. I recognized everything's familiarity. The
figures on the wall I recognized with a new way of looking.
And I also recognized the cockroach's vigil. The cockroach's
vigil was life living, my own vigilant life living itself out.
I felt in my robe pockets, found a cigarette and matches, lit it.
In the sun the white mass on the cockroach was becoming
dryer and slightly yellowed. That told me that more time had
passed than I had imagined. A cloud covered the sun for an
instant, and I suddenly saw the same room sunless.
Not dark, just lightless. I then perceived that the room existed
in itself, that it wasn't just the sun's heat, it could also be cold
and calm like the moon. Imagining what its moonlit night might
be like, I breathed in deeply, as though I had entered a calm
backwater. Even though I also knew that the cold moon wasn't
the room either. The room was a thing in itself. It was the
high monotony of a breathing eternity. That intimidated me.
The world would not intimidate me only if I became the world.
If I am the world I won't be afraid. If one is the world, one is
directed by a delicate, guiding radar.
When the cloud passed, the sun became clearer and whiter in
the room.
Once in a while, in the flick of a second, the cockroach would
flutter its antennae. Its eyes kept looking at me monotonously,
the two neutral, fertile ovaries. In them I recognized my own
two anonymous neutral ovaries. And I didn't want to, oh how
I didn't want to!
I had taken the telephone off the hook, but someone might
come ring the doorbell and I would be free! The blouse! the
blouse I bought, they said they were going to deliver it, so the
bell would ring!
No, it wouldn't ring. And I would be forced to keep on with
my realizations. And I recognized in the cockroach the insipidity
of when I was pregnant.
"I remembered myself walking the streets when I realized that
I would have the abortion, doctor, I who as regards children
only knew and only would know that I would have an
abortion. But at least I was experiencing pregnancy. On the
street, I could feel inside myself the child not yet moving, while
I stopped to look at the wax manikins smiling in the shop
windows. And when I went into the restaurant and ate, a
child's pores devoured the food like a waiting fish mouth.
When I walked, when I walked, I was carrying it."
In the interminable hours when I walked through the streets
thinking about the abortion, which had anyway already been
arranged with you, doctor, in those hours my eyes too must
have been insipid. On the street I too was no more than
thousands of neutral protozoan cilia, quavering, I now knew
within myself the shiny stare of a cockroach pinned at the
middle. I had walked through the streets with my lips parched,
and living, doctor, was the inside of a crime. Pregnancy: I had
been cast into the happy horror of neutral life that lives and
moves.
And while I was looking into the display windows, doctor, with
my dried lips like someone's who isn't breathing through his
nose, while I was looking at the stationary, smiling manikins, I
was full of neutral plankton and opened my quiet, suffocated
mouth and said this to you: "What bothers me most, doctor, is
that I have a hard time breathing." The plankton gave me my
color, the Tapajos River is green because its plankton is green.
When night arrived, I was still deliberating about the abortion
that had been decided on, lying on the bed with my thousands
of faceted eyes looking into the dark, my lips dark from
breathing, without thinking, without thinking, deliberating,
deliberating: on those nights I would gradually darken through
and through from my own plankton, just as the cockroach
matter was becoming yellower and yellower, and my gradual
darkening marked time's passing. And could all of that have
been love for the child?
If it was, then love is much more than love: love is yet before
love: it is plankton striving, and the great living neutrality
striving. Just like life inside the cockroach pinned around the
middle.
The fear I have always had of the silence that life is made up
of. Fear of the neutral. The neutral was my deepest, most alive
root—I looked at the cockroach and I knew. Till the moment I
saw the cockroach, I had always given what I was experiencing
some name, if I hadn't given it one I couldn't have saved
myself. To escape from the neutral, I had long since
abandoned the being for the persona, for the human mask. In
humanizing myself, I had freed myself from the desert.
I had freed myself from the desert, to be sure, but I had also
missed it! And I had also missed the forests, and I had missed
the air, and I had missed the embryo inside me.
There it is nevertheless, this neutral cockroach without a name
for love or suffering. Its only differentiation in life is that it has
to be either male or female. I had been thinking of it only as
female since whatever is caved in at the middle must be
female.
I put out the cigarette butt that was now burning my fingers, I
put it out carefully on the floor with my slipper, and I crossed
my sweaty legs, I never thought that legs could sweat so
much. We two, the buried alive. If I was brave, I would wipe
the sweat off the cockroach.
Did she sense something in herself equivalent to what my gaze
saw in her? how much did she do herself any good or get
any benefit from what she was? did she know, at least in
some indirect way, that she scraped along the ground? or isn't
scraping along the ground something that one knows one is
doing? How much did I know of what people saw clearly in
me? How would I know whether I did or did not go about
with my belly dragging in the dust of the ground? Does the
truth have no witness? is to be not to know? If a person
doesn't look and doesn't see, does the truth still exist? The
truth that is not communicated, not even to the one who is
looking. Is that the secret of a person's being a person?
If I want to, even now after everything that has happened is
over, I can still keep myself from having seen. And then I shall
never know about the truth I am trying to go through
again—it still depends on me!
I was looking around at the dry, white room, where I saw
only sands and more sands of the demolition, some covering
over the others. The minaret where I stood was made of hard
gold. I was on the hard, unreceptive gold. And I needed to be
received. I was afraid.
"Mother: I have taken a life, and there are no arms to receive
me now and in the hour of our desert, amen. Mother,
everything has now turned into hard gold. I have cut off an
organized thing, Mother, and that is worse than killing, that has
made me come in through a gap that offered itself to me,
worse than death, that showed me a whole, neutral life,
yellowing. The cockroach is alive, and its eye fecundates, I am
afraid of my raucousness, Mother."
And my mute raucousness was by then the raucousness of
someone who is availing herself of a calm Hell.
Raucousness—on the part of someone experiencing pleasure.
Hell was good for me, I was taking advantage of that white
blood I had spilled. The cockroach is real, Mother. It isn't just
the idea of a cockroach anymore.
"Mother, I only pretended to want to kill, but just see what I
have cracked: I have cracked a shell! Killing is also forbidden
because you crack the hard husk and you are left with viscous
life. From the inside of the husk, a heart that is thick and
white and living, like pus, comes out, Mother, blessed be you
among cockroaches, now and in the hour of this, my death of
yours, cockroach and jewel."
As if saying the word "Mother" had released a thick, white
part in me—the oratorio's intense resonance suddenly stopped,
and the minaret fell silent. And, like after a violent attack of
vomiting, my forehead was relieved, fresh, and cool. No more
fear, not even fright anymore.
 
 
 
 
 
No more fear, not even fright anymore.
Had I vomited up my last human remnants? And I wasn't
looking for help anymore. The day desert lay before me. And
now the oratorio started in again only in a different way, now
the oratorio was the deaf sound of the heat refracting off the
walls and ceilings, off the round ceiling vault. The oratorio was
made of the trembling of a heat wave. And my fear, too, was
different now: not the fear of someone who is still about to go
in but the so much greater fear of someone who has gone in.
So much greater: it was fear of my lack of fear.
For it was with my temerity that I then looked at the
cockroach. And I saw: it was an insect without beauty in the
eyes of other species. And when I looked at it, there the old,
small fear came back for just an instant: "I swear, I shall do
everything you want! but don't leave me trapped in the
cockroach's room because a huge thing is going to happen to
me, I don't like the other species! I like only people!
But, when I moved slightly backward, the oratorio only grew
more intense, and then I remained silent without attempting
another move to help myself. I had now abandoned myself—I
could almost see, there at the start of the path I had just
traveled, the body I had left behind. But I still called to it now
and again, still called myself. And it was when I couldn't hear
my reply anymore that I knew that I had finally left myself
beyond my own reach.
Yes, the cockroach was an insect without beauty in the eyes of
the other species. Its mouth: if it had teeth they would be
huge teeth, square and yellow. How I hate the sunlight that
shows all, shows even the possible. I wiped my forehead with
the corner of my robe, without taking my eyes off the
cockroach, and my own eyes too had the same lashes. But no
one touches yours, oh filthy one. Only another cockroach
would like this cockroach.
And me—who would like me this day? who had become as
mute as I? who, like me, was calling fear love? and wanting,
love? and needing, love? Who, like me, knew that she had
never changed shape since the time when they drew me on
the cave rock? beside a man and a dog.
From now on I could call anything the name I invented for it:
in the dry room one could do that, for any name would do
since none would do. Within the dry vault sounds, everything
could be called anything, because anything would be changed
into the same resonating muteness. The cockroach's much
greater nature made anything that came in there—name or
person—lose its false transcendence. As soon as I saw, only
and precisely, the white vomit of its body: I saw only facts and
things. I knew I was at the point of irreducibility, although I
didn't know what the irreducible was.
But I also knew that ignorance of the law of irreducibility was
no excuse. I could no longer excuse myself with the claim that
I didn't know the law—for knowledge of self and of the world
is the law that, even though unattainable, cannot be broken,
and no one can excuse himself by saying that he doesn't know
it. Worse: the cockroach and I were not in the presence of a
law to which we owed obedience. The renewed originality of
the sin is this: I have to carry out my own unknown law, and
if I don't carry out my unknowing, I shall be sinning originally
against life.
In the Garden of Eden, who was the monster and who was
not? amid the buildings and apartments, in the elevated spaces
between the skyscrapers, in that hanging garden . . . who is,
and who is not? To what extent can I stand not at least
knowing what is staring at me? the primal cockroach is staring
at me, and its law sees mine. I sensed that I was going to
know.
"Don't leave me at this moment, don't let me make alone this
already-made decision. I had, indeed I still had the desire to
take refuge in my own fragility and in the clever, though true,
argument that my shoulders were those of a woman, thin and
weak. Whenever I had needed to, I had excused myself with
the argument that I was a woman. But I understood well that
not only women fear seeing, everyone fears seeing him who is
God."
I was afraid of God's face, I was afraid of my final nakedness
on the wall. The beauty, that new absence of beauty that had
nothing to do with what I had been in the habit of calling
beauty, terrified me.
"Give me your hand. For I no longer know what I am
speaking of. I think I have invented it all, none of it has
existed! But if I invented what happened to me yesterday—who
can assure me that I didn't also make up my whole life prior
to yesterday?"
Give me your hand:
 
 
 
 
Give me your hand:
Now I'm going to tell you how I went into that
inexpressiveness that was always my blind, secret quest. How I
went into what exists between the number one and the
number two, how I saw the mysterious, fiery line, how it is a
surreptitious line. Between two musical notes there exists
another note, between two facts there exists another fact,
between two grains of sand, no matter how close together they
are, there exists an interval of space, there exists a sensing
between sensing—-in the interstices of primordial matter there is
the mysterious, fiery line that is the world's breathing, and the
world's continual breathing is what we hear and call silence.
It wasn't by using any of my attributes as an instrument that I
was reaching the mysterious, calm fire of that something that is
a plasma—it was precisely by stripping myself of all attributes
and going on with just my living innards. To arrive at that
point, I was leaving my human organization behind—in order to
go into that monstrous thing that is my living neutrality.
"I know, it's awful to hold my hand. It's awful to go without
air in this collapsed mine into which I have brought you,
without pity for you but because of pity for myself. But I
swear that I shall get you out of here alive—even if I have to
lie, even if I have to lie about what my eyes have seen. I'll
save you from this terror in which, for the moment, I need
you. What pity I now have for you, a person I have simply
latched on to. You gave me your hand innocently, and because
I could hold on to it I have had the courage to plunge to the
depths of myself. But don't try to understand me, just keep
me company. I know that your hand would let go if you
knew."
How can I repay you? At least use me too, at least use me
as a dark tunnel . . . and when you walk through my
blackness you will come out the other side with yourself. You
may not come out with me, I don't know if I'll go through,
but you'll come out with yourself. At least you won't be alone,
like I was yesterday, and yesterday I prayed just to get out
from inside alive. And not only alive—like that primary,
monstrous cockroach was only alive—but organizedly alive, like
a person.
Identity—identity which is the first immanence — was that what
I was giving in to? was that what I had gone into?
Identity is forbidden me, I know. But I am going to put myself
at peril by having faith in my future cowardice, and it will be
my essential cowardice that will reorganize me again into a
person.
Not only through my cowardice. But I shall reorganize myself
through the ritual with which I have now been born, just as
the ritual of life is inherent in the neutrality of semen. Identity
is forbidden me but my love is so great that I shall not resist
my will to go into the mysterious web, into that plasma that I
may never be able to leave. My belief, however, is also so
profound that, if I cannot leave, I know, even in my new
unreality, there will be the plasma of God in my life.
Oh, but at the same time, how can I want my heart to see? if
my body is so weak that I cannot look at the sun without my
eyes physically weeping—how could I keep my heart from
shining in physically organic tears if in nakedness I felt identity:
God? My heart, which has cloaked itself in a thousand veils.
The great, neutral reality of what I was experiencing outstripped
me in its extreme objectivity. I felt unable to be as real as the
reality that was reaching me—could I be starting in contortions
to be as nakedly real as what I was seeing? However, I
experienced all this reality with a sense of the unreality of
reality. Could I be living not truth but the myth of truth?
Whenever I experienced truth, it was through an impression of
unshakable dream: unshakable dream is my truth.
I am trying to tell you how I came to the neutrality and
inexpressivity of myself. I don't know if I am understanding
what I say, I feel—and I very much fear feeling, for feeling is
merely one of the styles of being. Still, I shall go through the
sultry torpor that swells with nothingness, and I shall have to
understand neutrality through feeling.
Neutrality. I am speaking of the vital element linking things. Oh,
I'm not afraid you won't understand but rather that I'll
understand myself poorly. If I don't understand myself, I shall
die of exactly what I'm still living on. Let me now tell you the
most frightening part:
I was being swept along by the demonic.
For the unexpressive is diabolical. If a person is not committed
to hope, she lives in the demonic. If that person has the
courage to leave her feeling behind, she discovers that huge life
of an extremely busy silence, the same sort that exists in the
cockroach, the same as in the stars, the same as in
herself—the demonic is prior to the human. And if that person
sees that nowness, she singes herself, as though she saw God.
Prehuman divine life is a life of singeing nowness.
 
 
 
 
Prehuman divine life is a life of singeing nowness.
I am going to tell you: the fact is that I was afraid of a
certain blind and now fierce joy that began to take me over.
And to make me lose myself.
The joy of losing oneself is a Black Sabbath joy. Losing oneself
is finding oneself dangerous. I was experiencing in that desert
the fire of things: and it was a neutral fire. I was living off the
whole span that things comprise. And it was a Hell, that
experience, because in that world that I was living there exists
neither pity nor hope.
I had come into the Sabbath orgy. I know now what is done
in the darkness of the mountains during nights of orgy. I
know! I know with horror: things are enjoyed. The thing of
which things are made is delighted in—that is the brute joy of
black magic. It was that neutrality that I experienced—neutrality
was my true cultural broth. I kept going on, and I was feeling
the joy of Hell.
And Hell is not the torture of pain! it is the torture of a
certain joy.
The neutral is unexplainable and alive, it seeks to understand
me: just as protoplasm and semen and protein belong to a
living neutrality. And I was completely new, like a new initiate.
It was as if up to now I had had my palate corrupted by salt
and sugar, my soul corrupted by pleasures and pains—and I
had never tasted the primary taste. And I now experienced the
taste of nothingness. I quickly uncorrupted myself, and the taste
was new like the taste of mother's milk that has a taste only
to the mouth of the child. With the collapse of my culture and
my humanity—which was a suffering with a great sense of loss
for me—with the loss of humanity, I came, orgiastically, to taste
the taste of things' identity.
It is very hard to taste. Up to then I had been so swollen
with feeling that when I experienced the taste of real identity, it
seemed as tasteless as the taste that a drop of rainwater has
in your mouth. It's horribly insipid, my love.
My love, it's like the blandest nectar—it's like the air, which in
itself has no smell at all. Up to then, my corrupted senses
were mute to the taste of things. But my most archaic and
demonic of thirsts had led me, subterraneously, to collapse all
constructs. Sinful thirst was guiding me—and I know now that
tasting the taste of that almost-nothingness is the gods' secret
joy. It is a nothingness that is God—and that has no taste.
But it is the most primary of pleasures. And only it—at last, at
last!—is the pole opposite to the pole of Christian-human feeling.
Through the pole of the first demonic pleasure I perceived, at
a great distance and for the first time . . . that there really
was an opposite pole.
I was clear of my own intoxication by feelings, clear to the
point of going into the divine life that was a primary life
entirely without elegance, a life as primary as if it was a
manna falling from the heavens without any taste whatsoever:
manna is like rain and has no taste. To taste that taste of
nothingness was my condemnation and my joyful terror.
Oh, my unknown love, remember that I was trapped there in
the caved-in mine and that by then the room had taken on
an unexpressible familiarity, like the familiar honesty of dreams.
And, just as in dreams, what I can't recount for you is the
atmosphere's essential color. Like in dreams, the "logic" was
other, was one that makes no sense when you wake up, for
the dream's greater truth is lost.
But remember that all this took place while I was awake and
immobilized by the daylight, and the dream truth was taking
place without the anesthesia of night. Sleep awake along with
me, and only then will you be able to know of my great sleep
and know what the living desert is like.
Suddenly, as I was sitting there, a fatigue completely rigid, with
no lassitude in it, came over me. Any more and it would have
petrified me.
Then, carefully, as though some parts of me were paralyzed, I
lay down on the rough mattress and there, burned through
and through, I went to sleep as immediately as a cockroach
goes to sleep on a vertical wall. There was no human stability
in my sleep: it was the kind of balance a cockroach has when
it sleeps on the whitewashed surface of a wall.
When I awoke, there was an even whiter and more fervidly
fixed sun in the room. After that sleep, to the dimensionless
surface of which my feet had clung, I was now trembling with
cold.
But then the numbness passed, and again, fully in the sun's
heat, I suffocated in confinement.
It must be past noon. I got up before I had really decided to
and, even though it was useless, tried to throw open even
wider the already fully opened window, and I tried to breathe,
even though it might be breathing from a visual vastness, I
sought a vastness.
 
 
 
 
I sought a vastness.
From that room dug out of the rock of a building, from the
window of my minaret, I saw all the way to the horizon the
enormous expanse of roof after roof calmly parching in the
sun. The apartment buildings, like villages, crouched on their
haunches. In size, it was larger than Spain.
Beyond the rocky defiles, between the concrete of the buildings,
I saw the favela on the hilltop, and I saw a goat slowly
walking up the hill. Beyond, there extended the plains of Asia
Minor. From there I contemplated the empire of the present.
The strait of the Dardanelles was farther over there; beyond it
the craggy peaks. Your majestic monotony. Your imperial
expanse, there in the sun.
And beyond, the sands began. The naked, burning desert.
When darkness fell, cold would consume the desert, and one
would shiver there like on desert nights. But in the distance
the salty blue lake shimmered. That, then, must be the region
of the great salt lakes.
Under the tremulous waves of sultry heat, monotony. Through
the other apartment windows and on the concrete balconies, I
saw the activity of shadows and people, like the comings and
goings of the first Assyrian merchants. They were fighting for
control of Asia Minor.
Perhaps I had excavated the future—or had got through to
ancient profundities coming from so far away that my hands
that had unearthed them could not even suspect. There I was,
on foot, like a child dressed in a habit, a sleepy child. But an
inquisitive child. From the height of this building, the present
contemplates the present. Just as in the second millennium
before Christ.
And I, now I was no longer an inquisitive child. I had grown,
and I had become as simple as a queen. Kings, sphinxes, and
lions, behold the city where I live—and all extinct! I am left
over, pinned down by one of the stones that fell. And, since
silence has judged my motionlessness to be that of a dead
person, they all forgot me, left without getting me out, and,
considered dead, I have stayed here, watching. And I have
seen, while the silence of those who had really died kept
invading me like ivy grows into the mouths of stone lions.
And because I was sure that I would end up starving to death
under the fallen stone that pinned down my limbs ... I saw like
someone who is never going to tell. I saw with the lack of
commitment of someone who is not even going to tell herself. I
saw very like someone who will never need to understand
what she saw. Just as a lizard's nature sees: without ever
having to remember. The lizard sees—like a loose eye sees.
I may have been the first person to set foot in that castle in
the air. Five million years ago, perhaps the last caveman looked
out from this very place, where there could then have been a
mountain here. And which, after it had worn down, later
became an empty place where, still later, cities were built that
had worn away in their turn. Today the ground is fully
populated by diverse races.
Standing at the window, sometimes my eyes rested on the blue
lake that may have been nothing more than a piece of sky.
But it soon wore me out, for the blue was made of a great
intensity of light. My bleary eyes then shifted to rest on the
naked, burning desert, which at least did not have the
hardness of a color. Three millennia from now, hidden oil
would gush from those sands: the present was opening gigantic
perspectives on a new present.
In the meantime, today, I lived in the silence of what three
millennia from now, after it had worn away and had been
raised again, would again be stairs, cranes, men, and buildings.
I was living the prehistory of a future. Like a woman who
never had children but would have them three millennia from
now, I was living today on the oil that would gush forth in
those three millennia.
If at least I had come into the room at sundown— tonight
would still be a full moon, I remembered that when I recalled
the party on the balcony last night—I would see the full moon
being born over the desert.
"Oh, I want to go back to my home," I suddenly entreated
myself, for the moist moon had made me yearn for my life.
But from that platform I got no moment of darkness and
moon. Only hot coals, only the errant wind. And for me no
canteen of water, no pipe of food.
But, who knows, less than a year later I might make such a
find as no one, not even myself, would have dared predict. A
golden chalice?
For I was looking for my city's treasure.
A city of gold and stone, Rio de Janeiro, whose inhabitants in
the sun were six hundred thousand beggars. The city's treasure
might be in one of the breaches in the rubble. But which one?
That city was in need of a map-maker.
As I lifted my gaze to ever more distant points, to even
steeper heights, there arose before me gigantic blocks of
buildings that formed a heavy design, one not yet shown on
any maps. I continued with that gaze, sought on the hill the
remains of some fortified wall. After they reached the top of
the hill I let my eyes run over the panorama. I mentally traced
a circle around the semiruins of the favelas, and I realized
that a city as large and limpid as Athens at its zenith could
once have lived there, with children running through
merchandise set out along the streets.
My way of seeing was entirely impartial: I worked directly with
the evidence of my sight, without letting suggestions other than
visual ones predetermine my conclusions; I was wholly
prepared to surprise myself. Even if the evidence should
contradict what I had decided on in my most tranquil delirium.
I know—through my own personal witness—that at the outset
of this search of mine I hadn't the slightest idea what kind of
language would slowly be revealed to me until I could one day
reach Constantinople. But now I was totally prepared to bear
in this room the hot, humid season of our climate, and with it,
cobras, scorpions, tarantulas, and hordes of mosquitoes that
come out when a city is demolished. And I knew that often, in
my work in the open air, I would have to share my bed with
the animals.
Meanwhile the sun was scorching me through the window.
Only today had the sun hit me full on. But it was also true
that only when the sun hit me could I myself, by standing up,
be a source of shade—in which I would keep fresh skins of
my water.
I was going to need a drill twelve meters long, camels, goats,
and sheep, an electric cable; and I was going to need direct
use of the vastness itself, for it would be impossible to
reproduce, for example, in a simple aquarium, the richness of
the oxygen found on ocean surfaces.
To keep my work spirit from flagging, I would try not to
forget that geologists now know that in the Sahara's subsoil
there is a huge lake of potable water, I remember reading
that; and that in the Sahara itself archaeologists have already
excavated remnants of household utensils and the remains of
ancient settlements: seven thousand years ago, I had read, a
prosperous agriculture had developed in that "region of fear."
The desert has a humidity that must be found again.
How should I proceed? to hold down the sand dunes, I would
have to plant two million green trees, especially eucalyptus
trees—I have always had the habit of reading something before
going to sleep, and I had read a lot about the properties of
eucalyptus trees.
And I must not forget, at the start of the work, to be
prepared to make mistakes. Not forget that mistakes had often
proved to be my path. Every time what I thought or felt didn't
work out ... a space would somehow open up, and if I had
had the courage before I would have gone in through it. But I
had always been afraid of delirium and error. My error,
however, had to be the path of truth: for only when I err do
I get away from what I know and what I understand. If
"truth" were what I can understand ... it would end up being
but a small truth, my-sized.
Truth must reside precisely in what I shall never understand.
And would I then be able to understand myself afterward? I
don't know. Will the man of the future understand us as we
are today? He, with distracted tenderness, will distractedly pat
our heads like we do with a dog who comes up to us and
looks at us from within its darkness, with silent, stricken eyes.
He, the future man, would pat us, remotely comprehending us,
just as I would remotely understand myself afterward, with the
memory of the memory of the long-lost memory of a time of
pain, but knowing that our time of pain would pass, just as a
child is not a static child but a growing being.
All right, after holding the sand dunes down with eucalyptus
trees, I couldn't forget, if it came up, that rice prospers in
brackish soil, the high salt content of which it helps to cut
down; that too I remembered from the bedtime reading that I
tried to keep impersonal so it would help me fall asleep.
And what other tools would I need to dig with? picks, a
hundred and fifty shovels, winches, even though I didn't know
exactly what a winch was, heavy carts with steel axles, a
portable forge, as well as nails and cord. As for my hunger,
for my hunger I would make use of the dates of ten million
palm trees, as well as peanuts and olives. And I had to know
beforehand that, at prayer time in my minaret, I could only
pray for the sands.
But for the sands I had probably been ready since I was
born: I would know how to pray them, for that I wouldn't
need to train myself ahead of time, like the witch doctors who
do not pray for things but pray things. Prepared I had always
been, so trained had I been by fear.
I remembered what was engraved in my memory, and up to
that moment, uselessly: that Arabs and nomads call the Sahara
El Khela, nothing, call it Tanesruft, the country of fear, call it
Tiniri, land beyond the pasture regions. To pray the sands, I,
like they, had already been prepared by fear.
Once again too scorched, I sought the great blue lakes, where
I submerged my dried-out eyes. Lakes or luminous spots of
sky. The lakes were neither ugly nor pretty. And it was only
that that still terrorized my humanity. I tried to think about the
Black Sea, I tried to think about the Persians coming down
through the passes . . . but in all this too I found neither
beauty nor ugliness, just the infinite successions of centuries of
the world.
Which, suddenly, I could no longer tolerate.
And I suddenly turned back to the inside of the room, which,
in its oppressiveness, at least was unpopulated.
 
 
 
 
I suddenly turned back to the inside of the room, which, in its
oppressiveness, at least was unpopulated.
No, in all of this I had not been crazy or out of control. It
was just a visual meditation. The danger of meditation is the
danger of starting to think without wanting to, and thinking is
no longer meditating, thinking leads toward an objective. Less
dangerous is to "see" in meditation, which bypasses words of
thought. I know that there now exists an electron microscope
that gives the image of an object a hundred and sixty
thousand times greater than actual size . . . but I wouldn't call
the sight that one gets through that microscope hallucinatory,
even though the small object that it has so monstrously
magnified is no longer identifiable.
Had I deluded myself in my visual meditation?
Absolutely probable. But also in my purely optical visions, of a
chair or a pitcher, I am the victim of error: my visual witness
of a pitcher or of a chair is faulty at various points. The error
is the error of my unalterable work methods.
I sat down on the bed again. But now, looking at the
cockroach, I knew much more.
Looking at it, I saw the vastness of the Libyan desert, in the
area of Elschele. The cockroach that had preceded me there
by millennia, and also preceded the dinosaurs. In the presence
of the cockroach, I was now able to see to far-off Damascus,
the oldest city on earth. On the Libyan desert, cockroaches and
crocodiles? All the time I had been wanting not to think about
what I was really thinking now: that the cockroach is edible
like a lobster, the cockroach was a crustacean.
And I have only loathing for crocodiles' crawling since I am
not a crocodile. I have a horror of the crocodile's silence, full
of rows of scales.
But the loathing is necessary for me just as water pollution is
necessary for what is in the water to reproduce. Loathing
directs me and makes me fertile. Through loathing I see a
night in Galilee. The night in Galilee is as if the vastness of the
desert walked in the darkness. The cockroach is a dark
vastness walking.
I was now living the Hell through which I was still to pass, but
I did not know if it would be passage through or if I would
remain there. I knew now that that Hell is horrible and is
good, perhaps I would want to stay in it. For I was seeing the
profound, ancient life of the cockroach. I was seeing a silence
that has the depth of an embrace. The sun is as much in the
Libyan desert as it is hot in itself. And the earth is the sun,
how is it that I never saw before that the earth is the sun?
And then there will take place—on a naked, dry rock in the
Libyan desert—there will take place the love of two cockroaches.
And now I know what it is like. One cockroach waits. I see its
brown-thing silence. And now—now I see another cockroach
advancing slowly and with difficulty through the sands toward
the rock. Upon the rock, which had had its body of water dry
up millennia ago, two dry cockroaches. One is the silence of
the other. The killers who face each other: the world is utterly
reciprocal. An entirely mute stridulation vibrating atop the rock;
and we, we who have come down to today, still resonate with
it.
"I promise myself for one day this same silence, I promise us
what I have now learned. Only for us it will have to be by
night, for we are moist, salty beings, we are beings of sea
water and of tears. It will also be with cockroaches' wholly
open eyes, except that it will be in the night, for I am a
creature of great, moist depths, I do not know the dust of dry
cisterns, and the surface of a rock is not my hearth."
We are creatures who need to dive to the depths in order
there to breathe, like fish dive in the water to breathe, only for
me the depths are in the night air. The night is our latent
state. And it is so moist that plants are born there. In houses
the lights are put out so the crickets can be heard more
clearly and so that the grasshoppers may move across the
leaves almost without touching them, the leaves, the leaves, the
leaves—in the night soft anxiousness is transmitted through the
air's hollowness, emptiness is a medium of transport.
Yes indeed, for us love will not be on the daytime desert: we
are those who swim, the night air is humid and is sweetened,
and we are salty since our breathing-out is sweat. A long time
ago I was drawn, along with you, on a cave wall, and with
you I have swum from its dark depths down to today, I have
swum with my countless cilia—I was the oil that just today
gushed forth, when a black African drew me in my own
house, making me come forth from a wall. Sleepwalking, like
the oil that finally gushes forth.
"I swear that love is like that. I know, only because I was
sitting there and I found out. Only because of the cockroach
do I know that all that the two of us had before was already
love. What had to happen was for the cockroach to hurt me
like someone pulling out my fingernails— and then I couldn't
stand the torture any longer and I confessed, and now I am
telling it all. I could stand no more and I confess that I
already knew of a truth that never had use and application,
and that I would be afraid to apply, for I am not adult
enough to be able to use a truth without destroying myself."
If you can find out through me, without having to be tortured
first, without first having to be cut in half by a wardrobe door,
without first having your shells broken, shells of fear that
through time had been hardening into shells of stone, just as
mine had to be broken under a pincers' force until I reached
the tender neutrality of myself— if you can find out through
me . . . then learn from this one who has had to be laid
completely bare and lose all her suitcases with the engraved
initials.
"Plumb me, plumb me, for it is cold, it is cold to lose your
lobstershells. Warm me with your plumbing, comprehend me,
for I do not comprehend myself. I am just in love with the
cockroach. And it is a Hellish love."
But you are afraid, I know that you were always afraid of
rituals. But when one is tortured until she becomes a nucleus,
then one changes demonically to wanting to serve ritual, even if
the ritual is the act of self-consumption—just as for there to be
incense one must burn incense. Listen, because I am as
serious as a cockroach with cilia. Listen:
When a person is her own nucleus, she can have no more
disparities. Then she is her own solemnity and no longer fears
self-consumption in the service of consuming ritual—ritual is the
very life of the nucleus carrying itself out, the ritual is not
outside it: the ritual is inherent. The cockroach has its ritual
within its cell. Ritual—believe in me because I think I
understand now—ritual is the mark of God. And every child is
born with the same ritual already there.
"I know: the two of us were always afraid of my solemnity
and of your solemnity. We thought it was a solemnity of form.
And we always hid what we knew: that living is always a
question of life and death, hence the solemnity. We knew too,
albeit without the gift of the grace of knowing it, that we are
the life that is inside us, and that we do for ourselves. The
only destiny with which we are born is the destiny of ritual. I
have been calling "mask" a lie, and it isn't: it is the essential
mask of solemnity. We would have to put on ritual masks to
love each other. Beetles are born with the mask with which
they will fulfill themselves. Through original sin we have lost
our mask."
I looked; the cockroach was a beetle. It was merely its own
mask. In the cockroach's lack of glee I perceived its warrior
ferocity. It was meek but its functioning was fierce.
I am meek but my life-function is fierce. Oh, prehuman love
invades me. I understand, I understand! The form of living is
so secret a secret that it is the silent tracking of a secret. It is
a secret in the desert. I knew for certain now. For in the light
of two cockroaches' love there came to me the memory of a
true love that I once had and didn't know that I had—for love
was then what I understood from a word. But there is
something that must be said, that must be said.
 
 
 
 
But there is something that must be said, that must be said.
"I am going to tell you what I have never told you before,
maybe that's what's missing: to have told. If I didn't tell, it
wasn't because I begrudged telling or because of my cockroach
silence with more eyes than mouth. If I didn't tell, it was
because I didn't know that I knew—but I know now. I am
going to tell you that I love you. I know that I have said that
to you before and that it was true when I said it then as well,
but only now am I really saying it. I need to say it before I .
. . . Oh, but it is the cockroach that is going to die, not me! I
don't need this condemned person's letter from a cell ..."
"No, I don't want to frighten you with my love. If you become
frightened of me, I'll become frightened of myself. Don't be
afraid of the pain. I am now as sure as I am sure that in
that room I was alive and the cockroach was alive: I am sure
of this: that everything happens above or below pain. Pain isn't
the true name of what people call pain. Listen: I'm sure of
this."
For, now that I was not struggling with myself any longer, I
quietly knew that that's what a cockroach was like, that pain
wasn't pain.
Oh, if I had known what was going to happen in the room I'd
have picked up more cigarettes before I came in: I was
consuming myself in the need to smoke.
"Oh, if only I could transmit to you the memory, just now
brought to life, of what we two have experienced without
knowing it. Do you want to remember along with me? Oh, I
know that it's hard: but let's reach out for ourselves. Instead
of going beyond ourselves. Don't be afraid now, you're safe
because at least it has already happened— unless you see
some danger in knowing that it happened."
The fact is that when we were in love I didn't know that love
happened much more precisely when there was no what we
then called love. The neuter of love, that is what we were
experiencing, and what we rejected.
What I am talking about is when nothing was happening, and
we called that nothing an interval. How could it have been an
interval?
It was the huge flower opening up, all full of itself, my vision
all huge and tremulous. What I saw then came together to my
sight and became mine—but not a permanent coming-together:
if I had compressed it between my hands like a piece of
coagulated blood, its solidity would have turned back into liquid
blood again between my fingers.
And time wasn't totally liquid only because, for me to be able
to pick things up with my hands, the things had to coagulate,
the way fruits hold together. In the intervals that we called
empty and tranquil, and when we thought that the love had
ended . . .
I remember my throat pains back then: with my swollen
tonsils, I had quick coagulation. And it melted easily: my throat
pain had gone away, I used to find myself telling you. Like
iceflows in the summer and the rivers running liquid. Every
word of ours—in that time that we called empty—every word
was as light and empty as a butterfly: the inner word fluttered
against the mouth, the words were said but we didn't hear
them because the melted iceflows made a great deal of noise
when they ran. In the midst of the roar of liquid, our mouths
moved, speaking, and we really only saw the mouths moving
but we didn't hear them—we looked into each other's mouth,
seeing it speak, and it mattered little that we didn't hear, oh, in
God's name, it mattered little.
And in our own name, it was enough just to see the mouth
speaking, and we laughed because we paid little attention. And
we nevertheless called that not-hearing disinterest and lack of
love.
But, really, how we did speak! we spoke nothingness. Yet
everything shimmered like when heavy tears cling to eyes;
therefore, everything shimmered.
In those intervals we used to think that we were relaxing from
one being the other. In fact, it was the great pleasure of not
being the other: for in that case we each were two. Everything
would end when what we called our interval in love ended;
and, because it was going to end, it weighed tremulously with
the very weight of its end already in itself. I remember all that
as though through a trembling in water.
Oh, could it be that we were not originally human? and that
we became human through practical necessity? that terrifies me,
just as it does you. For the cockroach looked at me with her
beetle shell, with her burst body all made of tubes and
antennae and soft cement—and that was undeniably a truth
prior to our words, it was undeniably the life that up to then I
hadn't wanted.
"Then—then, through the door of condemnation, I ate life and
was eaten by life. I understood that my kingdom is of this
world. And I understood it through the Hellish side of me. For
within myself I saw what Hell is like."
 
 
 
 
For within myself I saw what Hell is like.
Hell is the mouth that bites and eats living flesh that has
blood, and the one eaten howls with delight in his eye: Hell is
the pain like pleasure of matter, and with the laughter of
delight tears run in pain. And the tear that comes from pain's
laughter is the opposite of redemption. I could see the
cockroach's inexorability with her ritual mask. I saw that Hell
was just that: cruel acceptance of pain, solemn lack of pity for
one's own destiny, love of the ritual of life more than
oneself—that was Hell, where the one who ate the living flesh
of the other wallowed about in the happiness of pain.
For the first time I felt with Hellish greed the wish to have
borne the children I never had: I wanted my organic
Hellishness full of pleasure to have reproduced itself not in
three or four offspring but in twenty thousand. My future
survival in offspring would be my true nowness, which is not
only myself but my pleasureful species not losing its continuity.
Not having borne offspring left me spasmodic, as though I
were confronting a vice I had rejected.
That cockroach had had children and I had not: the cockroach
could die squashed, but I was condemned never to die, for if I
died, albeit only once, I would die. And I wanted not to die
but to keep perpetually dying like a supreme pleasure in pain.
I was in the Hell traversed by pleasure like a very low
nerve-buzz of pleasure.
And all that—oh, my horror—all that took place in the immense
refuge of indifference. ... All that losing itself in a spiraling
destiny, and that destiny not losing itself. In that infinite destiny
made only of cruel nowness, I, like a larva—in my deepest
inhumanity, for what had up to now escaped me had been my
real inhumanity—I and we as larvae devour each other in soft
flesh.
And there is no punishment! Hell is that; there is no
punishment. For in Hell we make what could be punishment
into supreme delight, in this desert we make punishment into
one more ecstasy of laughter with tears, in Hell we make
punishment into an expectation of pleasure.
Was this, then, the other side of humanization and of hope?
In Hell that demonic faith for which I am not responsible. And
which is faith in orgiastic life. Hell's orgy is the apotheosis of
the neutral. Black Sabbath joy is the joy of losing oneself in
the atonal.
What still frightened me was that even that very unpunishable
horror would be benignly reabsorbed into the abyss of endless
time, into the abyss of unending heights, into the profound
abyss of God: absorbed into the core of an indifference.
So different from human indifference. For it was an interested
indifference, an attainable indifference. It was an extremely
energetic indifference. And all is silence in that Hell of mine.
For the laughter forms part of the volume of the silence,
indifferent pleasure gleamed only in the eye, but laughter was
in the very blood and can't be heard.
And all this is in this very instant, is in the now. But at the
same time the present instant is completely removed because of
the immense magnitude of God. Because of that enormous
perpetual magnitude, even what exists at the present moment is
remote: in the very instant when the cockroach is crushed in
the wardrobe, it too is remote in relation to the core of great
interested indifference that will reabsorb it with impunity.
Grandiose indifference—was that what existed inside me?
The Hellish immensity of life: for even my body doesn't delimit
me, compassion doesn't allow my body to delimit me. In Hell,
my body doesn't delimit me, should I call that "soul"? To live a
life that is no longer the life of my body . . . should I call that
impersonal "soul"?
And my impersonal soul scorches me. A star's grandiose
indifference is the cockroach's soul, the star is the very
exorbitance of the cockroach's body. The cockroach and I
aspire to a peace that cannot be ours—it is a peace beyond
her scope and destiny, and mine. And because my soul is so
unlimited that it is no longer me, and because it is so beyond
me ... I am always remote from myself, I am unreachable to
myself just as a star is unreachable for me. I contort myself to
be able to touch the present time that surrounds me, but I
remain remote in relation to this very instant itself. The future,
God help me, is closer to me than the present instant.
The cockroach and I are Hellishly free because our living
matter is greater than we are, we are Hellishly free because
my own life is so little containable within my body that I can't
even use it. My life is used more by the earth than it is by
me, I am so much greater than what I have called "me" that
just by having a life of the world I would have myself. It
would take a horde of cockroaches to make a minimally
perceivable point in the world—however, one lone cockroach,
merely because of its life-attention, that lone cockroach is the
world.
The most unreachable part of my soul, the one not belonging
to me, is the part that touches on my border with what is not
me and the part to which I give myself over. My whole anxiety
has been this untranscendable and excessively close proximity. I
am more what is not within me.
And that is why the hand that I was holding has abandoned
me. No, no. It was I who let go of the hand, because I now
have to go on alone.
If I succeed in returning to the realm of life I shall pick up
your hand again, and I shall kiss it in gratitude for its waiting
for me, waiting for my sojourn to pass, for me to return, thin,
starved, humbled: hungry just for what is little, hungry just for
what is less.
Because, sitting here quietly, I have come to want to experience
my own remoteness as the only way of experiencing my
nowness. And that, which is apparently innocent, that was
again an enjoyment that resembled a horrendous, cosmic
pleasure.
To relive it, I am letting go of your hand.
Because in that enjoyment there was no pity. Pity is being the
offspring of someone or something—but the world's being is
cruelty. Cockroaches gnaw each other and kill each other and
penetrate each other in procreation and eat each other in an
eternal summer that falls into night— Hell is a summer that
boils and almost becomes night. Nowness doesn't see the
cockroach, present time looks at her from so great a distance
that it doesn't make her out from so far away and only sees
a silent desert—present time doesn't even suspect the orgiastic
gypsy celebration on the naked desert.
Where, reduced to tiny jackals, we eat each other in laughter.
In the laughter of pain—and free. The mystery of human
destiny is that we are fated, but we have the freedom to fulfill
or not fulfill our fate: realization of our fated destiny depends
on us. While inhuman beings like the cockroach realize the
entire cycle without going astray, because they make no
choices. But my freely becoming what I fate-fully am depends
on me. I am the mistress of my own fatedness, and, if I
decide not to complete it, I shall stay outside my specifically
living nature. But if I fulfill my neutral, living core, then, within
my species, I shall be being specifically human.
"But the fact is that becoming human can become transformed
into an ideal, and can suffocate itself through slow accretions ....
Being human should not be an ideal for humankind, which is
human by fate, being human has to be the way I as a living
thing obeying through freedom the path of living things, am
human. And I don't even need to take care of my soul, it will
fatefully take care of me, and I don't need to make a soul for
myself: I just have to choose to live. We are free, and this is
Hell. But there are so many cockroaches that it seems like a
prayer."
My kingdom is of this world . . . my kingdom was not merely
human. I knew. But knowing that would spread death-life, and
a child in my womb would be threatened with being eaten by
that very death-life, and without a Christian word even having
meaning . . . But there are so many children in the womb
that it seems like a prayer.
At that moment I still had not understood that the first outline
of what would be a prayer was already being born from the
happy Hell I had gone into and wanted never to leave again.
Never leave that country of rats and tarantulas and
cockroaches, my darling, where delight drops in thick drops of
blood.
Only God's compassion could pull me away from the terrible,
indifferent happiness in which I was bathing, bathing through
and through.
For I was exulting. I knew the violence of happy darkness —I
was as happy as the Devil, Hell is my maximum.
 
 
 
 
Hell is my maximum.
I was fully in the harbor of an indifference that is quiet and
alert. And in the harbor of an indifferent love, of an indifferent
waking sleep, of an indifferent pain. Of a God whom, if I loved,
I did not understand what He wanted of me. I know, He
wanted me to be His equal, and for me to equal Him through
a love I was not capable of.
Through a love so great that it would be love by a person so
indifferent . . . as if I were not a human person. He wanted
me to be the world with Him. He wanted my human divinity,
and that had to start with an initial despoliation of the
constructed human being.
And I had taken the first step: for at least I now knew that
being human is a sensitizing, an orgasm of nature. And that it
is only through an anomaly of nature that, instead of our being
God like other beings are, instead of our being Him, we
wanted to see Him. It wouldn't be bad to see Him if we were
as large as He is. A cockroach is larger than I am because its
life is so given over to Him that it comes from the infinite and
moves toward the infinite unperceivingly, it never becomes
discontinuous.
I had taken the first huge step. But what had happened to
me?
I had fallen into the temptation of seeing, into the temptation of
knowing and feeling. My grandeur, in search of God's
grandeur, had taken me to the grandeur of Hell. I had not
been able to understand His organization except through the
spasm of a demonic exultation. Curiosity had expelled me from
snugness—and I found the indifferent God who is all good
because He is neither bad nor good, I was in the harbor of a
matter that is the indifferent explosion of itself. Life had the
force of a titanic indifference. A titanic indifference that is
interested in moving. And I, who wanted to move along with it,
I had remained caught by the pleasure that made me merely
Hellish.
The temptation of pleasure. The temptation is to partake
directly of the source. The temptation is to partake directly of
the law. And the punishment is to want never to stop eating,
and to eat oneself, for I am likewise edible matter. And I
would seek condemnation like a joy. I would seek the most
orgiastic part of myself. I would never rest again. I had stolen
the hunting horse from a king of joy. I was now worse than
my very self!
I would never rest again: I had stolen the hunting horse from
the Sabbath king. If I drowse for an instant, the echo of a
whinny awakens me. It is useless not to go. In the darkness of
night, taking in a deep draught of air gives me the shivers. I
pretend to sleep, but in the silence the horse breathes. It says
nothing, but it breathes, it waits and breathes. Every day it will
be the same thing: right at nightfall I begin to turn melancholy
and pensive. I know that the first drum on the mountain will
make the night; I know that the third will have already
incorporated me in its thunder.
And by the fifth drum I shall already be unconscious of my
greed. Until by dawn, by the last, ever-so-light drums, I shall
find myself, without knowing how, near a stream, not ever
knowing what I have done, beside the enormous, tired horse's
head.
Tired from what? What have we done who ride in the Hell of
joy? I have not gone out for two centuries. The last time I
came down from the enchanted saddle, my human sadness
was so great that I swore never to again. The ride, however,
continues on in me. I converse, I clean the house, I smile, but
I know that the ride is within me. I feel lack, like one who is
dying. I can no longer keep from going out.
And I know that at night, when it calls me, I shall go out. I
want the horse to lead my thoughts once again. It was from it
that I learned. If this hour amid barking is thought. The dogs
bark, I begin to grow sad because I know, with my eye now
gleaming, that I shall go. When at night it calls me to Hell, I
shall go. I go down like a cat upon the roofs. No one knows,
no one sees. I offer myself up in the darkness, mute and
splendorous. Fifty-three flutes run after us. A clarinet lights our
way in front. And nothing more is given me to know.
At dawn I shall see us exhausted near the stream, without
knowing what crimes we have committed before the dawn's
arrival. In my mouth and on its feet the mark of blood. What
have we burned? At dawn I shall be afoot beside the silent
horse, with the first bells of a Church running down the
stream, with the rest of the flutes still running from my hair.
Night is my life, it grows late, the happy night is my sad
life—steal, steal the horse from me because from theft to theft I
have stolen even the dawn and made it a foreboding: quickly
steal the horse while it's time, while it's not too late, if there is
in fact still time, for to steal the horse I had to kill the king
and in killing him I have stolen the king's death. And the
happiness of the murder consumes me with pleasure.
I was consuming myself, for I too am living matter of the
Sabbath.
 
 
 
 
I was consuming myself, for I too am living matter of the
Sabbath.
Could this not be the temptation that the saints went through,
albeit much greater? And from which he who would be a saint
or not, emerges sanctified or not. Of this temptation on the
desert, I, dilettante, unholy, would succumb, or I would emerge
from it as for the first time a living being.
"Listen, there exists something that is called human sanctity,
and which is not the saints' sanctity. I fear that not even God
comprehends that human sanctity is more perilous than divine
sanctity, that the sanctity of the dilettante is more painful. Even
Christ himself may have known that if they were to do to him
what they did, they would do much more to us, for he had
said: If they have done this to the green bough, what will they
do with the dry ones?' "
Proof. Now I understand what proof is. Proof: it means that
life is testing me. But proof: it means that I too am proving.
And proving can be transformed into an ever more insatiable
thirst.
Wait for me: I am going to get you out of the Hell into which
I have descended. Listen, listen:
For from my delight without remission there was now being
born in me a sobbing that seemed to be one of happiness.
They were not sobs of pain, I had never heard them before:
they were the sobs of my life dividing to procreate me. On
those desert sands I was beginning to be delicate like a first,
timid offering, the offering of a flower. What did I offer? what
could I offer of myself—I who was the desert, I who had
sought and held it?
I offered a sob. I was finally crying within my Hell. The very
wings of blackness I use and sweat, and I used and sweated
them for myself, for me—for me are You, you, splendor of
silence. I am not You; me are You. For that reason alone will
I be able to sense You directly: because You are me.
 
Oh, God, I was beginning to understand with enormous
surprise: my Hellish orgy was human martyrdom itself.
How could I have guessed? if I hadn't known that one laughs
when suffering. I just didn't know that one could suffer so. It
was then that I called my profoundest suffering happiness.
And God came to me in the sob, God now occupied me
through. I offered God my Hell. The first sob had made—of
my terrible pleasure and of my celebration—a new pain, which
was now as light and helpless as the flower of my own desert.
The tears that were now running were like those for a love.
God, who could never be understood by me except as I
understood Him: breaking me like a flower that on birth can
barely raise itself and seems to break on its own.
But now that I knew that suffering had been my happiness, I
asked myself if I wasn't fleeing toward a God because I
couldn't bear my humanity. For I needed someone who would
not be as insignificant as I, someone who would be so much
greater than I that he could admit my disgrace without even
using pity, and consolation—someone who would be, who would
be! and not, like myself, an accuser of nature, and not, like
myself, someone frightened by the power of my own hates and
loves.
At this moment, now, a doubt overtakes me. God, or whatever
You are called: I now ask only one bit of help: but it is that
you help me, not in the obscure way in which you are me but
now openly, in plain sight.
For I need to know precisely this one thing: am I feeling what
I am feeling, or am I feeling what I wanted to feel? or am I
feeling what I would need to feel?
Because I no longer want even the concretization of an ideal
what I want is to be merely a seed. Even if, after that seed,
ideals are born again—be they true ideals, which are births of
a path, or false ones, which are mere accretions. Could I be
sensing what I would like to sense? For a millimeter's difference
is huge, and that millimeter of space can save me in truth or
make me again lose everything I have seen. It is perilous.
Humankind praises highly what it senses. Which is as perilous
as execrating what you sense.
I had offered God my Hell. And my cruelty, love of mine, my
cruelty had suddenly stopped. And suddenly that very desert
was the still-vague outline of what was called paradise. The
moistness of a paradise. Not something else, but rather that
very same desert. And I was surprised just as one is surprised
by a light that comes out of nowhere.
Did I understand that what I had experienced, that nucleus of
Hellish rapacity, was what is called love? But— neutral love?
Neutral love. The neutral was whispering. I was reaching what
I had sought after for my whole life: something that is the
most ultimate identity and that I had called inexpressive. It was
that that had always been in my eyes in the pictures: an
inexpressive happiness, a pleasure that does not know that it is
pleasure—a pleasure too delicate for my coarse humanity that
had always been made of coarse concepts.
"I had made so great an effort to talk to myself of a Hell
without words. Now how can I speak of a love that contains
only what is felt and before which the word "love" is just a
dusty object?"
The Hell I have gone through—how can I explain it to
you?—has been the Hell that comes from love. Oh, people
attach the idea of sin to sex. But how innocent and infantile a
sin that is. The real Hell is the Hell of love. Love is the
experiencing of a greater danger in sin—it is the experiencing of
the dirt and degradation and the worst of happiness. Sex is
the startling of a child. But how can I speak to myself of the
love that I now knew?
It's almost impossible. For in the neutrality of love there is a
continuous happiness, like a rustling of leaves in the wind. And
I fitted within the neutral nakedness of the woman on the wall.
The same neutrality, the neutrality that had consumed me in
pernicious, avid happiness, it was in that same neutrality that I
was now hearing another kind of continuous happiness of love.
What God is lay more in the neutral rustling of leaves in the
wind than in my old human prayer.
Unless I could make my prayer true and it would seem to
others and to me to be the cabala of a black magic, a neutral
murmuring.
That murmuring without any human sense would be my
identity touching the identity of things. I know that, in relation
to the human, that neutral prayer would be a monstrosity. But
in relation to him who is God, it would be: being.
I had been forced to go into the desert to find out with
horror that the desert is alive, to find out that a cockroach is
life. I had gone back until I found out that, in me, the most
profound life is before human life—and to do that I had had
the diabolical courage to let go of my feelings. I had had to
avoid giving human value to life in order to understand the
largeness, the much-more-than-human magnitude, of God. Had
I asked for the most dangerous and forbidden of things? would
I, risking my soul, have daringly demanded to see God?
And now it was as though I was before Him and did not
understand—I was uselessly on my feet before Him, and it was
once more a nothingness that I was before. For me, as for all
of us, everything had been given, but I wanted more: I wanted
to know about that everything. And I had sold my soul to
know. But I now understood that I had not sold it to the devil
but much more dangerously: to God. That He had let me see.
For He knew that I wouldn't know how to see whatever I
saw: the explanation of an enigma is the mere repetition of the
enigma. What are You? and the answer is: You are. What do
you exist? and the answer is: what you exist. I had the ability
to question but not the ability to hear the answer.
No, I hadn't even been able to formulate the question.
Nevertheless, the answer had continually posed itself to me
since I was born. It had been because of that insistent answer
that, in a reverse path, I had been forced to look for the
question to which it corresponded. Then I had lost myself in a
labyrinth of questions, and I asked questions at random, hoping
that one of them might occasionally correspond to the question
for my answer, and then I might be able to understand the
answer.
But I was like a person who, having been born blind and
having no sighted person at her side, that person couldn't even
formulate a question about vision: she couldn't know that
seeing existed. But, since vision did truly exist, even if that
person didn't know it within herself and had never heard of it,
that person would be still, anxious, alert, without being able to
ask questions about what she didn't know existed . . . she
would miss what should have been hers.
 
 
 
 
She would miss what should have been hers.
"No. I haven't told you all of it. I still wanted to see if I could
escape relying on myself just a little. But my liberation will be
realized only if I have the openness of my own lack of
understanding."
Because, sitting there on the bed, I then said to myself:
"I have been given everything, and just look at what that
everything is! it's a cockroach that is living and is close to
death. And then I looked at the door latch. After that, I looked
at the wood on the wardrobe. I looked at the window glass.
Just look at what that all is: it's pieces of something, a piece of
iron, of sand, of glass. I told myself: look what I have
struggled for, to have exactly what I had before, I crawled until
the doors opened for me, the doors of the treasure-room I
was looking for: and look at what that treasure was!
The treasure was a piece of metal, it was a piece of whitewash
on a wall, it was a piece of matter made into a cockroach.
In prehistory I had begun my march through the desert, and
without a star to guide me, only perdition guiding me, only
error guiding me—until, almost dead from the ecstasy of fatigue,
lighted by passion, I finally found the strongbox. And in the
strongbox, the sparkle of glory, the hidden secret. The most
remote secret in the world, opaque, but blinding me with the
radiation of its simple existence, sparkling there in a glory that
hurt my eyes. Inside the strongbox, the secret:
Pieces of something.
A piece of iron, a cockroach antenna, a chunk of mortar from
the wall.
My exhaustion prostrated itself at the feet of the piece of
something, in Hellish adoration. The secret of power was
power, the secret of love was love—and the jewel of the world
is an opaque piece of something.
The opacity reverberated in my eyes. The secret of my
millenary trajectory of orgy and death and glory and thirst until
I finally found what I always had, and for that I first had to
die. Oh, I am being so direct that I am starting to seem
symbolic.
A piece of something? the secret of the pharoahs. And because
of that secret I had almost given my life . . .
More, much more: to have that secret that I still couldn't
understand, I would again give my life. I had risked the world
in search of the question that comes after the answer. An
answer that remained a secret, even after what question it
corresponded to had been revealed. I hadn't found a human
answer to the enigma. But much more, oh much more: I had
found the enigma itself. Too much had been given me. What
could I do with what had been given me? "Let the holy thing
not be given to dogs."
And I was not even touching the thing. I was just touching
the space that goes from me to the vital core—I was within
the cohesive, controlled area of the vital core's resonance. The
vital core resonates at the resonance of my approach.
My closest possible approach stops a pace away. What keeps
the step forward from being taken? It is the opaque irradiation
simultaneously of the thing and of myself. We repel each other
through similarity; through similarity we do not enter each
other. And if the step were to be taken?
I don't know, I don't know. For the thing can never be really
touched. The vital core is a finger pointing to it— and what is
pointed to enlivens like a milligram of radium in the tranquil
darkness. Then the wet crickets start to be heard. The
milligram's light does not change the dark. For the dark is not
lightable, the dark is a way of being: the dark is the dark's
vital core, and something's vital core is never reached.
For me, will the thing have to be reduced to being just what
surrounds the thing's untouchability? My God, give me what
you have done. Or have you already given it to me? and am
I the one who cannot take the step that will give me what
you have done? Am I what you have done? and I can't take
the step toward myself, me whom You are, Thing and Yourself.
Give me what you are in me. Give me what you are in the
others, You are the he, I know, I know because when I touch,
I see the he. But the he, man, takes care of what you have
given him and wraps himself in a husk made especially for me
to touch and see. And I want more than the shell that I also
love. I want what I love You.
But beyond the shell I had found only the enigma itself. And I
trembled all over for fear of God.
I tremble with fear and adoration for what exists.
What exists and is just a piece of something, still I have to put
my hand over my eyes against the opacity of that thing. Oh,
the violent amorous unconsciousness of what exists surpasses
the possibility of my consciousness. I am afraid of so much
matter—matter resonates with attention, resonates with process,
resonates with inherent nowness. What exists beats with strong
waves against the unbreakable grain that is I, and that grain
tumbles among the abysses of tranquil billows of existence,
tumbles and does not dissolve, that seed-grain.
What am I the seed of? Seed of thing, seed of existence, seed
of those very billows of neutral love. I, a person, am a germ.
The germ is merely sensitive—that is its only particular quality.
The germ suffers pain. The germ is eager and cunning. My
eagerness is my most initial hunger: I am pure because I am
eager.
Of the germ that I am, this happy matter, the thing, is also
made. Which is an existence satisfied with its own process,
profoundly occupied in just its own process, and the process
resonates through all of it. That piece of thing inside the
strongbox is the casket's secret. And the casket is itself made
of the same secret, the strongbox in which the world's jewel is
found, it too is made of the same secret.
Oh, and I don't want all of that! I hate what I have come to
see. I don't want that world made of thing!
I don't want it. But I can't keep from feeling myself all filled
out inside by the poverty of opacity and neutrality: the thing is
alive like weeds. And if that is Hell, it is paradise itself: the
choice is mine. It is I who shall be demonic or an angel; if I
am demonic, this is Hell; if I am an angel, this is paradise. Oh,
I shall send my angel on ahead to prepare the path before
me. No, not my angel: but my humanity and its compassion.
I sent my angel on ahead to prepare the path before me and
to tell the stones that I was coming so they could be softened
for my lack of comprehension.
And it was my softest angel that found the piece of thing. It
could find only what it was. For even when something falls
from the sky it is a meteorite, that is, a piece of thing. My
angel allows me to adore a piece of iron or glass.
But it is I who should keep myself from giving the things a
name. A name is an accretion, and it inhibits contact with the
thing. The name of the thing is an interval for the thing. The
will to accretion is great . . . because bare things are so
wearing.
 
 
 
 
Because bare things are so wearing.
Oh, then that was the reason I had always had a sort of love
for tedium. And a continual hatred of it.
Because tedium is bland and so resembles the thing. And I
had not been big enough: only big people love monotony.
Contact with the supersound of the atonal has an inexpressive
happiness about it that only the flesh tolerates, in love. Big
people have the vital quality of the flesh, and they not only
tolerate the atonal but aspire to it.
My old constructs had consisted in continually trying to
transform the atonal into tone, in dividing the infinite into a
series of finites, and in not comprehending that the finite is not
a quantity, it is a quality. And my great discomfort in all of
that had been feeling that, no matter how large the set of
finites might be, it would not exhaust the residual quality of the
infinite.
But tedium—tedium had been the only way I had been able to
sense the atonal. And I hadn't known that I liked tedium only
because I suffered from it. But in regard to living, suffering is
not the measure of life: suffering is but a fateful subproduct,
and, because it is sharper, it is negligible.
Oh, and I should have understood all that before! I who
considered the inexpressive to be my secret concern. An
inexpressive face fascinated me; the moment that was not
climactic attracted me. Nature, what I liked in nature, was its
vibrant inexpressiveness.
"Oh, I don't know how to explain it to you, since I am
eloquent only when I err, error makes me deliberate and think.
But how can I talk to you if there is a silence when I say the
right thing? How can I tell you about the inexpressible?"
Even in tragedy, for real tragedy resides in the inexorability of
its inexpressiveness, which is its bare identity.
At times—at times we manifest inexpressiveness ourselves—in art
that is done, in bodily love too—to manifest the inexpressive is
to create. At bottom we are so, so happy! for there is not just
one way to enter into contact with life, there are also the
negative ways! also the painful ways, even the all-but-impossible
ones—and all that, all that before we die, all that even while we
are awake! And there is also at times the exasperation of the
atonal, which is a profound happiness: exasperated atonality is
flight rising—nature is exasperated atonality, thus it was that
worlds were formed: atonality became exasperated.
And let us look to the leaves, being heavy and green as they
are, they have exasperated into things, for blind are the leaves
and green they are. And let us feel in our hands how
everything has weight, weight does not escape the inexpressive
hand. Let the person who is completely absent not be
awakened, whoever is absorbed is feeling the weight of things.
One of the proofs of the thing is weight: only something with
weight can fly. And the only thing that can fall—celestial
meteorite—is something that has weight.
Or is all this just my still wanting the pleasure of the words
for things? or is it my still wanting the orgasm of utmost
beauty, of understanding, of the consummate act of love?
Because tedium is made of too primary a happiness! And that
is why paradise is intolerable to me. I don't want paradise, I
long to go back to Hell! I am not equal to the task of staying
in paradise because paradise has no human taste! it has the
taste of thing, and the vital thing had no taste, just like blood
in my mouth when I cut myself and suck the blood, I am
frightened because my own blood has no human taste.
And mother's milk, which is human, mother's milk is prehuman
by far, and it has no taste, it is nothing, I have tried it—it is
like the sculpted eye of a statue, which is empty and
expressionless, for when art is good it is because it has
touched inexpressiveness, the worst art is expressive art, the
land that transgresses the piece of iron and the piece of glass,
and the smiles, and the shouts.
"Oh, hand that holds me, if I had not needed so much of
myself to form my life, I would have had life!"
But on the human plane that would have been destruction:
living life instead of living one's own life is forbidden. It is a sin
to go into divine matter. And that sin has an inexorable
punishment: the person who dares go into that secret, in losing
her individual life, disorganizes the human world. I could also
have left my solid construction in the air, even knowing that it
was dismantleable ... if it hadn't been for temptation. And
temptation can keep one from getting to the other shore.
But why not stay inside, without trying to cross to the opposite
bank? Staying inside the thing is madness. I don't want to stay
inside, for if I do my prior humanization, which was so
gradual, would come to have had no basis.
And I don't want to lose my humanity! oh, losing it hurts, my
sweet, like leaving a still-living body that refuses to die, like the
cut-up pieces of a lizard.
But now it was too late. I would have to be bigger than my
fear, and I would have to see what my prior humanization had
been made of. Oh, I have to believe with such faith in the
true, hidden seed of my humanity that I shouldn't be afraid of
seeing humanization on the inside.
 
 
I shouldn't be afraid of seeing humanization on the inside.
"Give me your hand again, I still don't know how to console
myself about truth."
But—sit here a moment with me—the greatest disbelief in the
truth of humanization would be to think that truth would
destroy humanization. Wait for me, wait: I know that later on
I'll learn how to fit all that into daily practice—don't forget that
I too need daily life!
But look, love of mine, truth can't be bad. The truth is what it
is—and precisely because it is immutably what it is, it had to
be our great security, just as desiring our father or our
mother is so inevitable that it has to have been our basis. That
is it, then, the way, do you understand? why should I be
afraid of consuming good or evil? if they exist it is because
that is what exists.
Wait for me, I know that I am moving toward something that
hurts because I am losing other things—but wait for me to go
on a little farther. From all this, who knows, a name may be
born! a name without word, but one that will perhaps set the
roots of truth in my human formation.
Don't be afraid like I am afraid: it can't be bad to have seen
life in its very plasma. It is dangerous, it is sinful, but it can't
be bad, because we are made of that plasma.
"Listen, don't be afraid: remember that I have eaten the
forbidden fruit and was nonetheless not struck down by the
orgy of being. Listen, then: that means that I shall save myself
even more than I would have saved myself if I hadn't eaten of
life. . . . Listen, it is because I dove into the abyss that I am
beginning to love the abyss I am made of. Identity can be
dangerous because of the intense pleasure that may become
mere pleasure and nothing more. But I am now accepting love
for the thing."
It isn't dangerous, I swear it isn't dangerous.
For the state of grace exists permanently: we are always saved.
The whole world is in a state of grace. A person is smitten by
sweetness only when she perceives that she is in the state of
grace, to sense when you are in grace is itself the gift, and
few take the risk of recognizing that in themselves. But there is
no danger of perdition, I know that now: the state of grace is
inherent.
"Listen. I was accustomed only to transcending. Hope, for me,
had been deferral. I had never left my soul free, and I had
quickly organized myself into a person because it is too risky
to lose form. But now I see what was really happening to me.
I had so little faith that I had merely invented the future, I
believed so little in what exists that I had deferred nowness for
a promise and for a future."
But now I discover that it isn't even necessary to have hope.
It is much more serious. Oh, I know that I am getting
involved again in dangerous matters and that I ought to leave
off speaking to myself. One shouldn't say that hope isn't
necessary, for that could end up being changed, since I am
weak, into a destructive weapon. And for you, it could end up
being changed into a useful weapon of destruction.
I might not understand and you might not understand that
doing away with hope ... in fact implies action, and right now.
No, it isn't destructive—wait, let me understand us. It's a
forbidden topic not because there's anything bad about it but
because we put ourselves at risk.
I know that for me to abandon what was a life completely
organized by hope, I know that abandoning all that—in favor of
that wider something that is just being alive—abandoning all
that hurts like separating from a yet-unborn child. Hope is a
yet-unborn, only promised child, and that is crushing.
But I know that at one and the same time I want and don't
want to hold myself back anymore. It's like being in a death
agony: within death something wants to get free and
simultaneously is afraid to leave the safety of the body. I know
that it is perilous to speak about lack of hope, but listen—there
is a profound alchemy taking place inside of me, and it was
forged in the fire of Hell. And that gives me the greater right:
the right to err.
Listen without fright or suffering: God's neutrality is so great
and vital that I, because I could not bear God's cell, I had
humanized it. I know that it is horribly dangerous to discover
now that God has the power of impersonality .. . because I
know, oh, I know! that it is as if that meant the destruction of
entreaty!
It is as if the future stopped emerging. And we can do nothing
about it, we are deficient.
But listen a minute: I'm not speaking of the future, I'm
speaking of a permanent nowness. And that means that hope
doesn't exist because it is no longer a deferred future, it is
now. Because God doesn't promise. He is much greater than
that: He is and never ceases being. It is we who cannot bear
this ever-now light, and so we promise it for later only so we
do not have to feel it right now, today. The present is God's
today face. The horror is that we know that it is right in life
that we see God. It is with our eyes truly open that we see
God. And if I put the face of reality off until after my death—it
is through guile, for I prefer to be dead at the time of seeing
Him, and so I think I won't really see Him, just as I have
courage really to dream only when I am sleeping.
I know that what I am feeling is serious and has the power to
destroy me. Because—because it is as though I were telling
myself that the kingdom of heaven is now.
And I don't want the kingdom of heaven, I don't want it, I
can bear only its promise! The message I am getting from
myself sounds cataclysmic to me, and once again close to the
diabolical. But that is only for fear. It is fear. For doing away
with hope means that I have to begin to live and not just to
promise myself that I will. And that is the greatest fright I can
have. Before, I waited. But God is now: His kingdom has just
begun.
And His kingdom, my precious, is also of this world. I didn't
have the courage to stop being a promise, and I promised
myself, like an adult who doesn't have the courage to see that
she has become an adult and keeps promising herself maturity.
And that's how I knew that the divine promise of life is now
being fulfilled, and that it has always been fulfilled. Previously,
only from time to time was I reminded, in a vision
instantaneous and then suddenly remote, that promise is not
only for the future, it is yesterday and it is permanently today:
but that was jarring for me. I preferred to keep on entreating,
without having the courage to have, now.
And I do have. I shall always have. It's only needing that I
have. Needing never stops, for needing is the nature of my
neutrality. What I do with entreaty and with lacking . . . that
will be the life I shall have made of my life. Not putting myself
in the face of hope isn't the destruction of entreaty! and it isn't
abstention from lack. Oh, it is rather to add to it, it is to add
infinitely to the entreaty born of lack.
 
 
 
 
 
To add infinitely to the entreaty born of lack.
It isn't for us that cows' milk comes forth, but we drink it.
Flowers weren't made for us to look at or for us to smell, and
we look at them and smell them. The Milky Way doesn't exist
for us to know of its existence, but we know. And we know
God. And what we need of Him, we get out of that. (I don't
know what it is I'm calling God, but it can be called that.) If
we know but very little about God, it is because we need little:
we have of Him only what is destined to sustain us, we have
of God what fits in us. (Nostalgia is not for the God who is
missing to us, it is a nostalgia for ourselves, for we do not
sustain ourselves; we miss our impossible grandeur—my
unreachable nowness is my paradise lost.)
We suffer because we have so little hunger, although our small
hunger is still enough for us to feel the profound loss of the
pleasure we would have if we had a greater hunger. Milk
people drink only as much as the body needs, and flowers we
see only as far as the eyes reach and their fullness skims.
However much more we need, the more God exists. However
much farther we reach, that much more of God shall we have.
He enables us. (He wasn't born for us, nor were we born for
Him, we and He are, at the same time.) He is uninterruptedly
occupied in being, like all things are being, but He doesn't keep
people from joining Him and, with Him, being occupied in
being, in an interchange as fluid and constant ... as the
interchange of living. He, for example, He uses us totally, for
there is nothing in each one of us that He, whose need is
absolutely infinite, doesn't need. He uses us, and doesn't keep
people from making use of Him. The ore in the earth isn't
responsible for not being used.
We are very far behind and have no idea of how to take
advantage of God in an interchange—as though we still hadn't
discovered that milk is for drinking. A few centuries ago, or a
few minutes ago we may perhaps say, in alarm: and to think
that God was always there! the one who was there very little
was I—just as we would say of oil that people finally needed
enough to learn how to extract it from the earth, just as one
day we will lament those who have died of cancer without
using the cure that is at hand. Surely we still don't need to die
of cancer. Everything is at hand. (Perhaps beings on another
planet already know these things and already live in an
interchange that is natural for them; for us, now, that
interchange would amount to "holiness" and would completely
confound our lives.)
Cows' milk we drink. And if the cow doesn't let us, we have
recourse to violence. (In life and in death anything goes, living
is always a life-and-death question.) With God too you can
make your way through violence. He Himself, when he
especially needs one of us, He chooses us and violates us.
But my violence toward God has to be a violence toward
myself. I have to do violence to myself so I can need more.
So that I become so desperately greater that I become empty
and needy. I shall thus have touched the root of needing. The
great emptiness in me will be where I exist; my extreme
poverty will be a great will. I have to do violence to myself
until I have nothing and need everything; when I need then I
will have, for I know that it is only just to give more to the
one who asks for more, my demand is my size, my emptiness
my measure. You can also do violence directly unto God, with
a love full of anger.
And He will understand that that furious, murderous avidity of
ours is in fact our sacred, vital fury, our attempt to violate
ourselves, the effort to eat more than we can so as to increase
our hunger artificially—in the demand for life everything is
legitimate, even the artificial, and the artificial is often the great
sacrifice that is made to get to the essential.
But, since we are little and therefore need but little, why is
little not enough for us? Because we sense pleasure. Like blind
men who feel their way along, we have presentiments of the
intense pleasure of living.
And if we have presentiments, it is also because we feel that
we are being alarmingly used by God, we feel alarmingly that
we are being used with an intense and uninterrupted pleasure
—moreover, up to now our salvation has been one of being at
least so used, we are not useless, we have been made intense
use of by God; body and soul and life are for that: for
someone's interchange and ecstasy. Disquieted, we feel that we
are being used every minute—but that awakens in us the
disquieting desire to use as well.
And He not only allows but needs to be used, being used is a
way of being understood. (In all religions God demands to be
loved.) For us to have, all we need is to need. To need is
always the supreme moment. Just as the most daring
happiness between a man and a woman comes when needing
becomes so great that it is felt in agony and wonder: without
you I will be unable to live. Love's revelation is a revelation of
lacking—blessed be the poor of spirit for the sundering realm
of life is theirs.
If I abandon hope, I am celebrating my lack, and that is the
greatest solemnity of living. And because I have taken up my
lack, life is at hand. Many have been those who have
abandoned everything they had and set out in search of a
greater hunger.
Oh, I have lost timidity: God now is. We have already been
proclaimed, and it has been my own errant life that has
proclaimed me to the right one. Beatitude is the continuous
pleasure of the thing, the process of the thing is made of
pleasure and of contact with what is gradually needed more
and more. My whole fraudulent struggle came from my not
wanting to assume the promise that can be fulfilled: I didn't
want reality.
For to be real is to take up the promise itself: to assume
innocence itself and take up again the taste we were never
aware of: the taste of the living.
The taste of the living.
Which is an almost nonexistent taste. And that because things
are very delicate. Oh, the efforts to experience the Host.
The thing is so delicate it astonishes me that it ever becomes
visible. And there are things so much more delicate that they
are not visible. But they all have a delicacy equivalent to what
it means for our body to have a face: that sensitization of the
body that is a human face. The thing has a sensitization about
itself that is like a face.
Oh, and I didn't know how to consubstantiate my "soul." It
isn't immaterial, it is of the most delicate thing-material. It is
thing, but what I can't do is consubstantiate it in visible depth.
Oh, my love, things are very delicate. People tread upon them
with too many human feet, with too many sentiments. Only the
delicacy of innocence or only the delicacy of the initiate senses
its almost nonexistent taste. Before, I needed seasoning for
everything, and in that way I skipped over the thing and
tasted the taste of the seasoning.
I couldn't taste the taste of a potato, because a potato is
almost earth matter; the potato is so delicate that—because of
my inability to live on the delicacy level of the merely earthly
taste of a potato—I put my human foot on top of it and
broke its living-thing delicacy. Because living matter is very
innocent.
And my own innocence? I ache of it. Because I also know
that, on the merely human plane, innocence is having the
cruelty that the cockroach has with itself in slowly dying without
pain; to transcend pain is the highest cruelty. And I am afraid
of that, I who am extremely moral. But I now know that I
have to have a much greater courage: the courage to have
another morality, so empty that I don't understand it myself
and it frightens me.
"Oh, I haven't forgotten you who are the oldest thing in my
memory. I see you again, putting the wires together to fix the
electric plug, being careful of the positive and negative lines,
and handling things delicately."
I didn't know that I had learned so much from you. What did
I learn? I learned to look at a person putting together electric
wires. I learned to see you fix a broken chair once. Your
physical energy was your most delicate energy.
"You were the oldest person I had ever met. You were the
monotony of my eternal love, and I didn't know it. I had for
you the same tedium that I feel on holidays. What was it like?
it was like water running in a stone fountain, and the years
marked on its smooth stone, the moss half-pushed back by the
current of running water, and the cloud above, and the
beloved man in repose, and static love, it was a holiday, and
the silence in the mosquitoes' flight. And the available present.
And my slightly boring liberty, the fullness, the fullness of a
body that does not seek and does not need."
I didn't know how to see that that was a delicate love. And it
seemed like tedium to me. It was in fact tedium. It was a
person's quest to frolic, the wish to plumb the depths of the
air, to contact the air in the profoundest way, the air that is
not there to be plumbed, that is destined to remain suspended
as it is.
I don't know, I remember that it was a holiday. Oh how much
I wanted pain then: it would distract me from that great divine
emptiness that I had with you. I, the goddess in repose; you,
on Olympus. The great yawn of happiness? Distance following
itself distantly, and the other distance, and yet another—the
fullness of space that a holiday has. That unfolding of calm
energy, I didn't even understand. That now-thirstless kiss on
the distracted forehead of the beloved man in repose, the
pensive kiss of the man now loved. It was a national holiday.
Flags hoisted.
But night falling. And I couldn't bear the slow transformation of
something that is slowly transforming itself into the same
something, merely added to by yet another identical drop of
time. I recall that I told you:
"I have a little bit of a stomachache," I said, breathing with
some satiety. "What shall we do tonight?"
"Nothing," you answered, so much wiser than I. "Nothing, it's
a holiday," said the man who was delicate with things and with
time.
The profound tedium —like a great love—bound us together.
And the next morning, early in the morning, the world was
opening itself to me. Things' wings were open, it was going to
be a hot afternoon, you could feel it in the cool sweat of the
things that had passed the tepid night, like in a hospital where
the patients awake still alive.
But all that was too fine for my human foot. And I, I sought
beauty.
But now I have a morality that dispenses with beauty. I shall
have to bid a nostalgic good-bye to beauty. Beauty was a soft
enticement to me, it was the way I, weak and respectful,
adorned the thing to be able to bear its core.
But now my world is the world of the thing that before I
would have called ugly or monotonous—and is neither ugly nor
monstrous to me anymore. I have gone through gnawing the
earth, through eating the ground, and I have gone through
having that kind of an orgy, and through feeling with moral
horror that the earth I gnawed also felt pleasure. My orgy in
fact came from my puritanism: pleasure offended me, and from
the offense I created greater pleasure. Nevertheless, this present
world of mine, I would have called it violent before.
For water's tastelessness is violent, the colorless-ness of a piece
of glass is violent. A violence is all the more violent because it
is neutral.
My present world is raw, it is a world of a great vital difficulty.
For, more than a star, I now wish the thick, black root of the
stars, I wish the source that always seems dirty, and is dirty,
and is always incomprehensible.
It is with pain that I bid good-bye to the beauty of a child—I
want the adult, who is more primitive and ugly and drier and
more difficult, and who has become a seed-child that can't be
broken between the teeth.
Oh, and I want to see too if I can now dispense with horses
drinking water, which are so pretty. I also do not want my
sensibility because it makes beauty; and could I dispense with
the sky moving in clouds? and with flowers? I don't want
pretty love. I don't want half-light, I don't want a well-made
face, I don't want the expressive. I want the inexpressive. I
want the inhuman within the person; no, it isn't dangerous, for
a person is human anyway, it isn't necessary to struggle for
that: wanting to be human sounds too pretty to me.
I want the materiality of things. Humanity is steeped in
humanization, as though it were necessary; and that false
humanization impedes man and impedes his humanity. There
exists a thing that is broader, deafer, and deeper, less good,
less bad, less pretty. Even though that thing too runs the risk
of becoming transformed into "purity" in our gross hands, our
hands that are gross and full of words.
 
 
 
 
Our hands that are gross and full of words.
"You'll have to bear my telling you that God isn't pretty. I say
that because He is neither a result nor a conclusion, and
everything that people find pretty is often only because it is
already brought to a close. But what is ugly today will be seen
as beauty centuries from now, because it will have completed
one of its movements."
I don't want any longer the completed movement that in reality
is never completed but that we complete in our desire; I don't
want any longer to enjoy the ease of liking something simply
because, since it is apparently complete, it no longer frightens
me, and then is falsely mine—I, devourer of beauty that I was.
I don't want beauty, I want identity. Beauty would be an
accretion, and I am going to dispense with it. The world has
no intention of beauty, and that would have shocked me
before: in the world there exists no aesthetic plane, not even
the aesthetic plane of goodness, and that would have shocked
me before. The thing is much more than that. God is greater
than goodness and its beauty.
Oh, getting rid of all that means so great a disillusionment. But
it is in disillusionment that the promise is fulfilled, through
disillusionment, through pain that the promise is fulfilled, and it
is for that reason that one must first pass through Hell: until
one sees that there is a much deeper way of loving and that
way does away with the accretion of beauty. God is what
exists, and all the contradictions are within God, and therefore
they don't contradict Him.
Oh, everything in me is aching to leave what was the world for
me. Leaving is so harsh and aggressive an attitude that a
person who opens her mouth to talk of leaving should be
arrested and held incommunicado—I prefer to consider myself
temporarily out of my own control rather than have the
courage to think that all that is true.
"Give me your hand, don't leave me, I swear that I too didn't
want it: I too lived well, I was a woman to whom you could
refer with the phrase 'the life and loves of G. H.' I can't put
the system into words, but I lived in a system. It was as
though I organized myself around the fact of having a
stomachache because, if I no longer had it, I would also lose
the marvelous hope of one day getting rid of the stomachache:
my old life was necessary to me because it was precisely its
error that made me take up imagining a hope that, without
the life that I led, I wouldn't have known."
And now I am risking an entire entrenched hope, in favor of
a reality so much greater that I cover my eyes with my arm
because I can't face head-on a hope so immediately
fulfillable—even before I die! So much before I die. I also
scorch myself in that discovery: the discovery that there exists
a morality in which beauty is a huge, timid superficiality. Now
what invokes me and calls me is neutrality. I have no words
to express it, and I therefore speak of neutrality. I have only
that ecstasy that too is no longer what we have been calling
ecstasy, for it isn't culmination. But that culminationless ecstasy
expresses the neutrality of which I speak.
Oh, to speak to myself and to you is being mute. To speak to
God is what exists that is even more mute. To speak to things
is mute. I know that that sounds sad to you, and to me as
well, for I am still corrupted by the condiment of the word.
And that is the reason that silence hurts me like an
abandonment.
But I know that I must abandon myself: contact with the thing
must be a murmur, and to speak to God I must put together
unconnected syllables. My lacking came from the fact that I
had lost my inhuman side—I had been expelled from paradise
when I became human. And true prayer is the silent oratorio
of inhumanity.
No, I don't have to rise through prayer: I must, ingurgitated,
make myself a resonant nothingness. What I speak to God
about has to make no sense! If it makes sense, it is because I
err.
Oh, don't misunderstand me: I am taking nothing away from
you. What I am doing is demanding of you. I know that it
seems like I am taking away your and my humanity. But it's
exactly the opposite: what I want is to live of that initial and
primordial something that was what made some things reach
the point of aspiring to be human. What I want for myself is
to live of the most difficult part of humanity: to live of the
germ of neutral love, for it was from that source that there
began to sprout what later became distorted into
sentimentations to the extent that the core became suffocated
by the accretion of richness and squashed inside us by the
human foot. It is a much greater love that I am demanding of
myself—it is so much greater a life that it doesn't even contain
beauty.
I now have that hard courage that hurts me like the flesh
transformed in childbirth.
But no, I still haven't told all.
Not that what I'm going to tell now is all that's left. Much
more has been left out of this account that I am giving to
myself; father and mother are missing, for example; I still
haven't had the courage to honor them; many of the
humiliations I have gone through are missing, and I omit them
because the only people who are humiliated are those who
aren't humble, and instead of humiliation I should talk about
my lack of humility; and humility is much more than a feeling,
it is reality seen through minimal good sense.
Much yet remains to tell. But there is one thing that it will be
imperative to say.
(One thing I know: if I reach the end of this account, I'll go,
not tomorrow but yet today, to eat and dance at the
Top-Bambino, I mightily need to have a good time and distract
myself. I'll be sure to wear my new blue dress that makes me
look a little thinner and gives me color, I'll phone Carlos,
Josefina, Antonio, I don't remember clearly which one of the
two men I thought might be in love with me or if both were,
I'll eat crevettes and not worry about how many, and I know
why I'll eat crevettes tonight, tonight my regular life will be
starting again, the life of my common happiness, I'll need for
the rest of my days my slight, sweet, good-humored
commonness, I, like everybody, need to forget.)
But I haven't told everything.
 
 
 
 
But I haven't told everything.
I haven't said how, sitting there motionless, I still hadn't
stopped looking with deep disgust, yes, still with disgust, at the
yellowed white mass on top of the cockroach's grayness. And I
knew that as long as I had that disgust the world would evade
me and I would evade myself. I knew that the basic error in
living was finding cockroaches disgusting. Finding disgust in the
thought of kissing a leper was my missing the primary life
inside me ... for disgust contradicts me, contradicts my matter
in me.
Then what, in pity for myself, I didn't want to think, then, I
thought. I couldn't hold myself back anymore, and I thought
that I was now truly thinking.
Now, in pity of the anonymous hand that I hold in mine, in
pity for what that hand is not going to comprehend, I don't
wish to take it with me to the horror that yesterday I went to
alone.
For I suddenly knew not only that the moment had arrived to
understand I could no longer transcend but also that the
instant had arrived when I really could no longer transcend.
And to have now what I always before thought should be for
tomorrow. I am trying to save you, but I cannot.
For redemption must be in the thing itself. And redemption in
the thing itself would be my putting into my own mouth the
white paste from the cockroach.
At just the idea I closed my eyes with the force of someone
locking her jaws, and I clenched my teeth so tight that any
more and they would break right inside my mouth. My insides
said no, my mass rejected the cockroach's mass.
I had stopped sweating; I had dried completely out again. I
tried to reason with my disgust. Why should I be disgusted by
the mass that came out of the cockroach? had I not drunk of
the white milk that is the liquid maternal mass? and when I
drank the stuff that my mother was made of, hadn't I,
wordlessly, called it love? But reason didn't get me anywhere,
except to keep my teeth clenched together as though they
were made of flesh that was ashiver.
I couldn't.
There was only one way I could: if I gave myself a hypnotic
command, and then I could in effect go to sleep and act as
though I were in a sleepwalking trance—and when I opened
my eyes from that sleep the thing would be "done," and it
would be like a bad dream you wake up feeling free from
because you were dreaming that your life was so much worse.
But I knew that I couldn't do it that way. I knew that I would
really have to eat the cockroach mass, and all of me eat it,
even my very fear eat it. Only then would I have what
suddenly seemed to me to be the anti-sin: to eat the
cockroach mass is the anti-sin, sin that would kill myself.
The anti-sin. But at what a price.
At the price of my going through the sensation of death.
I arose and took a step forward, with the determination not of
someone who is bent on suicide but of someone who is going
to kill herself.
The sweat had begun again, I was now dripping from head to
toe, the honeyed toes of my feet ran inside my slippers, and
the roots of my hair softened before that viscous thing that
was my new sweat, a sweat that I didn't recognize and that
had a smell like the smell that comes up from parched ground
when it gets the first rain. That profound sweat was, however,
what gave me life, I was slowly swimming in the oldest broth
of my culture, the sweat was plankton and pneuma and
pabulum vitae, I was being, I was being me.
No, my darling, it wasn't good in the sense that we use the
word good. It was what we call awful. In fact, very, very awful.
For the root of me, that I was only now experiencing, had the
taste of a potato tuber, mixed with the earth it had been
pulled out of. Nevertheless, that bad taste had a strange grace
of living that I can understand only if I sense it again and can
explain only while I do.
I took another step forward. But instead of going on ahead, I
suddenly threw up the bread and the milk I had eaten at
breakfast that morning.
Shaken through and through by the violent vomiting, which
had come without any warning nausea, disappointed with
myself, frightened by my lack of strength to carry out an act
that seemed to me to be the only thing that would bring my
soul and body together again.
Despite myself, after vomiting I had become serene, my head
relieved, physically calm.
What was worse: I still had to eat the cockroach, but without
the aid of my prior exaltation, the exaltation that would have
acted within me like hypnosis; I had thrown up my exaltation.
And unexpectedly, after the revolution that is vomiting, I felt
physically simple like a child. It would have to be in that state,
like a child carelessly happy, that I would eat the cockroach
mass.
Then I stepped forward.
My happiness and my shame came when I awoke from my
faint. No, it hadn't been a faint. It had been more like a dizzy
spell, for I was still on my feet, my hand propped against the
wardrobe. A dizzy spell that had made me lose track of the
moments, of time. But I knew, even before thinking, that, while
I had been gone in the dizzy spell, "something had happened."
I didn't want to think about it, but I knew. I was afraid to
taste in my mouth what I was tasting, I was afraid to run my
hand over my lips and feel any remains. I was afraid to look
toward the cockroach—which must now have less of a white
mass on its opaque back . . .
I was ashamed that I had had to become dizzy and
unconscious to do something that now I would never afterward
know how I did ... for I had taken away all my participation
before I did it. I hadn't really wanted to "know."
Was that, then, the way we do things? "Not knowing"—was
that the way the most profound things happened? would
something always, always have to be apparently dead for the
really living to happen? had I had not to know that it was
living? Was the secret of never escaping from the greater life
the secret of living like a sleepwalker?
Or was living like a sleepwalker the greatest act of confidence?
the act of closing your eyes in dizziness and never knowing
what took place.
Like a transcendence. Transcendence, which is the
remembrance of the past or of the present or of the future. In
me was transcendence the only way I could reach the thing?
For even in eating of the cockroach, I had acted by
transcending the very act of eating. And now all I was left with
was the vague recollection of a horror, I was left with only the
idea.
Until the recollection was so strong that my body shouted all
in itself.
I dug my fingernails into the wall: now I tasted the bad taste
in my mouth, and then I began to spit, to spit out furiously
that taste of nothing at all, taste of a nothingness that
nonetheless seemed to me almost sweetened with the taste of
certain flower petals, taste of myself—I spit myself out, never
reaching the point of feeling that I had finally spit out my
whole soul. "Because you are neither hot nor cold, because you
are tepid, I will vomit you out from my mouth," was the
Revelation according to St. John, and the phrase, which must
refer to other things that I now no longer remembered, the
phrase came to me from the depths of my memory, serving
as the insipidity of which I had eaten— and I was spitting.
Which was difficult: because the neutral thing is extremely
energetic, I spat and spat and it kept on being me.
I only stopped in my fury when I realized with surprise that I
was undoing everything I had laboriously done, when I realized
that I was betraying myself. And that, poor me, I couldn't get
beyond my own life.
I stopped, shocked, and my eyes filled with tears that just
burned and didn't run. I think I didn't feel that I was even
worthy of having tears run, I lacked the basic pity for myself
that lets one cry, and I retained in my burning pupils the tears
that spread salt on me and that I didn't deserve to have run.
But even though they didn't run, the tears were such
companions to me and bathed me with such compassion that I
lowered a head that had been consoled. And, like one who
returns from a trip, I sat down again quietly on the bed.
I who had thought that the best proof of my internal
metamorphosis would be to put the cockroach's white mass
into my mouth. And that in that way I would approach . . .
the divine? the real? For me the divine is the real.
 
 
 
For me the divine is the real.
But kissing a leper isn't even goodness. It is reality in itself, it
is life in itself—even if that also means the leper's salvation. But
it is first one's own salvation. The saint's greatest benefit is to
himself, which is unimportant: for when he reaches the great
vastness itself, thousands of people are enlarged by his vastness
and live on it, and he loves others just as much as he loves
his own terrible vastness, he loves his opening-out with lack of
pity for himself. Does the saint wish to purify himself because
he feels the need to love the neutral? to love what is not an
accretion, and to dispense with the good and the attractive.
The saint's great goodness ... is that for him everything is the
same. The saint scorches himself until he reaches love of the
neutral. He needs it for himself.
I then understood that, no matter the situation, living is a great
good in relation to others. All one has to do is live, and that
in itself brings about that great good. He who lives totally is
living for others, he who lives his own vastness is giving a gift,
even if his life takes place in the cloister of a cell. Living is so
great a gift that thousands of people benefit from every lived
day.
"Does it pain you that God's goodness is neutrally continuous
and continuously neutral? But what I had wanted as a miracle,
what I called "miracle," was in fact a desire for discontinuity
and interruption, the desire for anomaly: what I called "miracle"
was the precise moment when the true, continuous miracle of
process was interrupted. But God's neutral goodness is still
more entreatable than it would be if it weren't neutral: it is
just going and having, just asking and having."
And miracles too can be sought and had, for continuity has
interstices that don't make it discontinuous, the miracle is the
note that lies between two musical notes, the number that lies
between the number one and the number two. It's just a
question of seeking and having. Faith ... is knowing that you
can go consume the miracle. Hunger, that is what faith is in
and of itself—and needing is my guarantee that it will always
be given to me. Necessity is my guide.
No. I didn't need to have the courage to eat the cockroach
mass. For I lacked the saint's humility: I had given the act of
eating it a sense of "maximum." But life is divided into qualities
and species, and the law is that cockroaches will be loved and
eaten only by other cockroaches; and that a woman, at the
moment of her love for a man, that woman is experiencing
her own species. I realized that I had just done the equivalent
of experiencing the cockroach mass ... for the law is that I
should live with person-matter and not cockroach-matter.
I realized that by putting the cockroach mass in my mouth, I
was not bereaving myself as saints bereave themselves, but
rather I was again seeking accretion. Accretion is easier to love.
And now I am taking your hand in to my own. I am the one
who is giving you my hand.
I need your hand now, not so I won't be afraid but so you
won't. I know belief in all this will, in the beginning, be a great
solitude for you. But the moment will arrive when you will give
me your hand, no longer in solitude, but as I do now: in love.
Just like me, you won't be afraid to add yourself to God's
extreme energetic sweetness. Solitude is simply having human
destiny.
And solitude is not needing. Not needing leaves a person alone,
all alone. Oh, needing doesn't isolate a person, things need
things: it's enough to see a chick walking to see that its
destiny will be what lack will make of it, its destiny is to join,
like drops of mercury cling to other drops of mercury, even
though, like all drops of mercury, it has a complete and
rounded existence in itself.
Oh, my love, don't be afraid of that lacking: it is our greater
destiny. Love is so much more fateful than I thought, love is
as ingrained as is lack itself, and we are guaranteed by
necessity that it is continually renewed. Love is now, is always.
All that is missing is the coup-de-grâce— which is called
passion.
 
 
 
 
All that is missing is the coup-de-grâce—which is called passion.
What I am now feeling is a happiness. Through the live
cockroach I am coming to understand that I too am that
which lives. To live is a very high stage, it is something I have
just now attained. It is so high an unstable equilibrium that I
know I won't be able to stay aware of it for long— the grace
of passion is short.
Perhaps to be human like us is merely a special sensitization
that we call "having humanity." Oh, I also fear losing this
sensitization. Till now I had called my sensitivity to life "life"
itself. But to live is something else.
To live is a gross, radiating indifference. To be alive is
unreachable by the most delicate of sensibilities. To be alive is
inhuman—the deepest meditation is one that is so empty that a
smile is exhaled as though it came from some matter. And I
shall be even more delicate, and more permanent in my state.
Am I speaking of death? am I speaking of after death? I don't
know. I sense that "nonhuman" is a great reality, and that that
doesn't mean "inhuman": to the contrary, the nonhuman is the
radiating center of a neutral love in radio waves.
If my life is transformed into it-itself, what I now call sensibility
will not exist—it will be called indifference. But I am still unable
to learn that way of being. It is as if hundreds of thousands of
years from now we finally won't be what we feel and think
anymore: we shall have something that more closely resembles
an "attitude" than an idea. We shall be living matter
manifesting itself directly, unmindful of words, going beyond
always-grotesque thinking.
And I won't travel "from thought to thought" but from attitude
to attitude. We shall be inhuman—as humankind's greatest
conquest. To be is to be beyond the human. To be a human
being doesn't do it, to be human has been a constraint. The
unknown awaits us, but I sense that that unknown is a
totalization and will be the true humanization we long for. Am
I speaking of death? no, of life. It isn't a state of felicity, it is a
state of contact.
Oh, don't think that all this doesn't make me sick, in fact I
find it so boring that it makes me impatient. But it resembles
paradise, where I can't even imagine what I'd do, for I can
only imagine myself thinking and feeling, two attributes of one's
being, and I can't imagine myself just being and ignoring the
rest. Just to be—that would leave me with an enormous need
of something to do.
At the same time, I was a little bit doubtful.
The fact is that, just as earlier I had become terrified before
by my entrance into what could develop into despair, I now
suspected that I was again transcending things . . .
Could I be enlarging the thing too much precisely to go
beyond the cockroach and the piece of iron and the piece of
glass?
I don't think so.
For I wasn't reducing hope to a simple result of construction
and counterfeiting, nor was I denying the existence of
something to hope for. Nor was I removing the promise: I was
merely sensing, with enormous effort, that hope and promise
are fulfilled at every instant. And that was terrifying, I have
always feared being stricken by realization, I had always
thought of realization as a final resting point—and I hadn't
foreseen a situation where necessity is ever being born.
And also since I was afraid, because I couldn't stand simple
glory, that I would make it one more accretion. But I know—I
know—that there is an experiencing of glory in which life has
the purest taste of nothingness and that in glory I feel it to be
empty. When living is realized, the question will be asked: but
was that all there was to it? And the answer: that isn't all
there is, it is exactly what there is to it.
Only I still have to be careful not to make more of it than
that, for if I do it won't be that anymore. Essence is a piercing
insipidity. I'll have to "purify myself" much more just not to
want the accretion of events. Before, self-purification implied
cruelty for me, against what I called beauty and against what I
called "me," without knowing that "me" was an accretion to
myself.
But now, through my most difficult fright I am finally moving
toward the opposite path. I am moving toward the destruction
of what I have constructed, I am moving toward
depersonalization.
I am anxious for the world, I have strong, definite desires,
tonight I'll go dancing and eating, I won't wear my blue dress,
I'll wear my black-and-white one instead. But at the same time,
I don't need anything. I don't even need a tree to exist. I now
know a modality that dispenses with everything—and also with
love, with nature, with objects. A mode that dispenses with me.
Even though, as regards my desires, my passions, my contact
with a tree—they may keep on being for me like a mouth
eating.
Depersonalization like the deposing of useless individuality—the
loss of everything that can be lost, while still being. To take
away from yourself little by little, with an effort so attentive that
no pain is felt, to take away from yourself like one who gets
free of her own skin, her own characteristics. Everything that
characterizes me is just the way I am most easily viewed by
others and end up being superficially recognizable to myself.
Just as there was the moment when I saw that the cockroach
was the cockroach of all cockroaches, so too I want from me
to encounter the woman of all women in myself.
Depersonalization as the great objectification of oneself. The
greatest externalization one can attain. Whoever is touched by
depersonalization will recognize the other in any guise: the first
step in relation to the other is to find in oneself the man of all
men. Every woman is the woman of all women, every man is
the man of all men, and every one of them could appear
wherever humankind is judged. But only in immanence,
because only a few people reach the point of recognizing
themselves in us. And then, in the simple presence of their
existence, revealing our own.
What is lived of—and since it has no name only silence
enunciates it—is what I approach through the great amplitude
of ceasing to be myself. Not because I may then discover the
name and make the impalpable concrete—but because I
determine the impalpable to be impalpable, and then the breath
builds again like in the flame of a candle.
The gradual deheroization of oneself is the true labor that is
performed under merely apparent labor, life is a secret mission.
Real life is so secret that not even I, who am dying of it, have
been given the password, I am dying without knowing of what.
And the secret is such that only if the mission is finally carried
out do I, all of a sudden, see that I was born entrusted with
it—all of life is a secret mission.
The deheroization of myself is undermining the ground beneath
my edifice, doing so despite me like an unknown calling. Until
it is finally revealed to me that life in me does not bear my
name.
And I also have no name, and that is my name. And because
I depersonalize to the point of not having a name, I shall
answer every time someone says: me.
Deheroization is the grand failure of a life. Not everyone can
fail because it is such hard work, one must first climb painfully
up to get to the height to fall from —I can only achieve the
depersonality of silence if I have first built an entire voice. My
cultures were necessary to me so that I could climb up to
have a point to come down from. It is precisely through the
foundering of the voice that one hears for the first time one's
own silence and that of others and of things, and accepts it as
the possible language. Only then is my nature accepted,
accepted with its wonderous torture in which pain isn't
something that happens to us but what we are. And our
condition is accepted as the only one possible since it is what
exists and none other. And since the experience of it is our
passion. The human condition is Christ's passion.
Oh, but to reach silence, what a huge effort of voice. My voice
is the way I go to seek reality; reality prior to my language
exists as an unthinkable thought, but I was and am fatefully
impelled to have to know what thought thinks. Reality precedes
the voice that seeks it, but like the earth precedes the tree, but
like the world precedes the man, but like the sea precedes the
view of the sea, life precedes love, bodily matter precedes the
body, and one day in its turn language shall have preceded
possession of silence.
I have to the extent that I determine—and that is the splendor
of having a language. But I have much more to the extent
that I am unable to determine. Reality is raw material, language
the way I seek it—and how I don't find it. But it is from
seeking and not finding that what I have not known is born,
and I instantly recognize it. Language is my human endeavor. I
have fatefully to go seeking and fatefully I return with empty
hands. But—I return with the unsayable. The unsayable can be
given me only through the failure of my language. Only when
the construct falters do I reach what it could not accomplish.
And it is useless to try to take a shortcut and start right in,
knowing already that the voice says little, starting already with
depersonalization. For the trajectory exists, and the trajectory is
more than just a way of proceeding. We ourselves are the
trajectory. In living one can never arrive ahead of time. The
via crucis isn't a wrong way, it is the only way, you get there
only through it and with it. Insistence is our effort, desistance
is the prize. One gets the prize when she has experienced the
power of building and, in spite of the taste of power, prefers
desistance. Desistance has to be a choice. To desist is a life's
most sacred choice. To desist is the true human moment. And
it alone is the glory proper to my condition.
Desistance is a revelation.
 
 
 
 
Desistance is a revelation.
I desist, and I shall have been the human person — it is only
for the worst part of my condition that it is taken up as my
destiny. Existing demands of me the huge sacrifice of having
no power, I desist and, behold, the world fits in my weak
hand. I desist and to my human poverty there opens the only
joy that is given me to have, human joy. I know this and I
tremble—living leaves me so much in wonder, living keeps me
from going to sleep.
I reach the height from which I can fall, I choose, I tremble,
and I desist, and finally, devoting myself to my fall,
depersonalized, without a voice of my own, in the last analysis
without myself—behold that everything I don't have is mine. I
desist and the less I am, the more alive, the more I lose my
name, the more I am called, my only secret mission is my
condition, I desist and the more I am ignorant of the password
the more I carry out the secret, the less I know the more the
sweetness of the abyss is my destiny. And then I adore.
With my hands quietly folded in my lap, I was experiencing a
sense of tender, timid happiness. It was almost a nothingness,
like when the breeze makes a blade of grass quiver. It was
almost nothing, but I could see the tiny movement of my
timidity. I don't know, but I was approaching something with
anguished idolatry and with the delicacy of one who fears. I
was approaching the strongest thing that had yet happened to
me.
Stronger than hope, stronger than love?
I was appoaching what I think was . . . confidence. Perhaps
that's its name. Or it doesn't matter: you could give another
one just as well.
I felt that my face was smiling in sweat. Or perhaps it wasn't
smiling, I don't know. I was confident.
In myself? in the world? in God? in the cockroach? I don't
know. Perhaps having confidence doesn't involve having it in
something or someone. Perhaps I now knew that I would
never be equal to life myself, but that my life was equal to life.
I would never reach my root, but my root did exist. I had
timidly let myself be transfixed by a sweetness that abashed me
without constraining me.
Oh God, I felt baptized by the world. I had put cockroach
matter into my mouth; I had finally performed the lowest of all
acts.
Not the greatest of all acts as I had thought before, not
heroism and sainthood. But in the final analysis, the lowest of
all acts was what I had always needed. I had always been
incapable of the lowest of acts. And like that lowest of acts, I
had deheroized myself. I, who had lived of the middle of the
road, had finally taken the first step at its start.
Finally, finally, my husk had really broken, and I was, without
limit. By not being, I was. To the edge of what I wasn't, I
was. What I am not, I am. Everything will be within me, if I
am not; for "I" is merely one of the world's instantaneous
spasms. My life doesn't have a merely human sense, it is
much greater—it is so much greater that, in relation to human
sense, it is senseless. Of the general organization that was
greater than I, I had till now perceived only the fragments. But
now I was much less than human . . . and I would realize
my specifically human destiny only if I gave myself over, just
as I was doing, to what was not me, to what was still
inhuman.
And giving myself over with the confidence of belonging to the
unknown. For I can pray only to what I do not know. And I
can love only the unknown evidence of things and can add
myself only to what I do not know. Only that is a real giving
of oneself.
And such a giving of myself is the only surpassing that doesn't
exclude me. I was now so much greater that I no longer saw
myself. As great as a landscape in the distance. I was in the
distance. More perceptible in my last mountains and in my
remotest rivers: simultaneous now-ness did not frighten me
anymore, and in the most ultimate extremity of myself I could
finally smile without smiling in the least. I finally extended
beyond my own sensibility.
The world interdepended with me—that was the confidence I
had reached: the world interdepended with me, and I am not
understanding what I say, never! never again shall I
understand what I say. For how will I be able to speak
without the word lying for me? how will I be able to speak
except timidly, like this: life is itself for me. Life is itself for me,
and I don't understand what I am saying. And, therefore, I
adore . . .
